<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Selenium-IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the tool you use to
develop your Selenium scripts.  Its an easy to use Firefox plug-in and is the
generally the most efficient way to develop test scripts.  It also contains a
context menu that allows you to first select a UI element from the browser&#8217;s
currently displayed page and then select from a list of Selenium commands
with parameters pre-defined according to the context of the selected UI
element.  This is not only a time-saver, but also an excellent way of
learning Selenium script syntax.</p>
<p>This chapter is all about the Selenuim IDE and how to use it effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-the-ide">
<h2>Installing the IDE<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-the-ide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using Firefox, first, download the IDE from the SeleniumHQ <a class="reference external" href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">downloads page</a></p>
<p>When downloading from Firefox, you&#8217;ll be presented with the following window.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/chapt3_img01_IDE_Installation.png" class="align-center" src="_images/chapt3_img01_IDE_Installation.png" /></div>
<p>Select Install Now.  The Firefox Add-ons window pops up, first showing a
progress bar, and when the download is complete, displays the following.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/chapt3_img02_IDE_Installation.png" class="align-center" src="_images/chapt3_img02_IDE_Installation.png" /></div>
<p>Restart Firefox.  After Firefox reboots you will find the Selnium IDE listed under the Firefox Tools menu.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/chapt3_img03_IDE_Installation.png" class="align-center" src="_images/chapt3_img03_IDE_Installation.png" /></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="opening-the-ide">
<h2>Opening the IDE<a class="headerlink" href="#opening-the-ide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To run the Sel-IDE, simply select it from the Firefox Tools menu.  It opens
as follows with an empty script-editing window and a menu for loading, or
creating new, your scripts.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/chapt3_img04_IDE_open.png" class="align-center" src="_images/chapt3_img04_IDE_open.png" /></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ide-features">
<h2>IDE Features<a class="headerlink" href="#ide-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The File menu allows you to create, open and save test script and test suite
files.  The Edit menu allows copy, paste, delete, undo and select all
operations for editing the commands in your script.  The Options menu allows
the changing of settings.  Specifically you can set the timeout value for
certain commands, add user-defined user extensions to base set of Selenium
commands, and you can specify the format (language) used when saving your
scripts.  The Help menu is the standard Firefox Help menu.  The Sel-IDE runs
within a Firefox browser window and therefore displays the standard Firefox
Help menu.  There is nothing specific to Selenium-IDE in the Help menu.</p>
<p>The toolbar contains buttons for controlling the execution of your test
scripts, including a step feature for debugging your scripts.  The right-most
button, the one with the red-dot, is the record button.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/chapt3_img05_IDE_features.png" class="align-center" src="_images/chapt3_img05_IDE_features.png" /></div>

<dd>Run All: Runs the entire test suite when a test suite with multiple test
scripts is loaded.</dd>
<dt><img alt="run" src="_images/chapt3_img08_Run.png" /></dt>
<dd>Run:  Runs the currently selected test.  When only a single test is
loaded this button and the Run All button have the same effect.</dd>
<dt><img alt="pause resume" src="_images/chapt3_img09_Pause.png" /></dt>
<dd>Pause/Resume:  Allows stopping and starting of a running script.</dd>
<dt><img alt="step" src="_images/chapt3_img11_Step.png" /></dt>
<dd>Step:  Allows one to &#8220;step&#8221; through a script by running it one command at a
time.  Use for debugging scripts.</dd>
<dt><img alt="testrunner" src="_images/chapt3_img12_TestRunner_Mode.png" /></dt>
<dd>TestRunner Mode:  Allows you to run the script in a browser loaded with
the Selenium-Core TestRunner.  The TestRunner is not commonly used now
and is likely to be deprecated.  This button is for evaluating scripts
for backwards compatibility with the TestRunner.  Most users will
probably not need this button.</dd>

<dd>Record:  Records the user&#8217;s browser actions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your script is displayed in the following window.  It has two tabs, one for
displaying the command and their parameters in a readable &#8220;table&#8221; format.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/chapt3_img15_Table_Format.png" class="align-center" src="_images/chapt3_img15_Table_Format.png" /></div>
<p>The Source tab displays the script in the native format in which the file
will be stored.  By default this is HTML although it can be changed to a
programming language such as Java or C#, or a scripting language like Python.
See the Options menu for details.  The Source view also allows one to edit
the script in it&#8217;s raw form, including copy, cut and paste operations.</p>
<p>The Command, Target, and Value entry fields display the currently selected
command along with its parameters (if any).  These are entry fields where you
can modify the currently selected command.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/chapt3_img16_Entry_Fields.png" class="align-center" src="_images/chapt3_img16_Entry_Fields.png" /></div>
<p>If you start typing in the Command field, a drop-down list will be populated
based on the first characters you type; you can then select your desired
command from the drop-down.</p>
<p>The bottom box displays the Log.  When you run your script, error messages,
and information messages showing the progress of your script, are displayed
here.  This is sometimes useful for script debugging.   Notice the Clear
button for clearing the Log.  Also notice the Info button is a drop-down
allowing selection of different levels of information to display.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="building-scripts">
<h2>Building Scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#building-scripts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three primary methods for developing scripts.  Frequently, a script
developer will require all three techniques.</p>
<div class="section" id="recording">
<h3>Recording<a class="headerlink" href="#recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many first-time users begin by recording a script from their interactions
with a website.  When Sel-IDE is first opened the record button is ON by
default.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This can be set to OFF as a default with an available user extension.</p>
</div>
<p>The Recorder will automatically insert commands into your script based on
your mouse clicks.  Typically, this will include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>clicking a link - <em>click</em> or <em>clickAndWait</em> commands</li>
<li>entering values - <em>type</em> command</li>
<li>selecting options from a drop-down listbox - <em>select</em> command</li>
<li>click checkboxes or radio buttons - <em>click</em> command</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s some &#8220;gotchas&#8221; to be aware of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>type</em> command may require clicking on some other area of the web page
for it to record.</li>
<li>Following a link usually records a <em>click</em> commands. You will often need to
change this to <em>clickAndWait</em> to ensure your script pauses until the new page
is completely loaded.  Otherwise, your script will continue running commands
before the page has loaded all its UI elements. This will cause unexpected
script failures.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-verifications-and-asserts-with-the-context-menu">
<h3>Adding Verifications and Asserts With the Context Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-verifications-and-asserts-with-the-context-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your scripts will also need to check the properties of a web-page.  This
requires <em>assert</em> and <em>verify</em> commands.  We won&#8217;t describe the specifics of
these commands here; that is in the chapter on Selenium commands.  Here we&#8217;ll
simply describe how to add them to your script.</p>
<p>With Sel-IDE recording, go to the browser displaying your test application and
right click anywhere on the page.  You will see a context menu showing <em>verify</em>
and/or <em>assert</em> commands.</p>
<p>The first time you use Selenium, there may only be one Selenium command listed.
As you use the IDE however, you will find additional commands will quickly be
added to this menu.  Selenium-IDE will attempt to predict what command, along
with the parameters, you will need for a selected UI element on the current
web-page.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how this works. Open a web-page of your choosing and select a block
of text on the page. A paragraph or a heading will work fine.  Now, right-click
the selected text.  The context menu should give you a <em>verifyTextPresent</em>
command and the suggested parameter should be the text itself.</p>
<p>Also, notice the Show All Available Commands menu option.  This shows many,
many more commands, again, along with suggested parameters, for testing your
currently selected UI element.</p>
<p>Try a few more UI elements. Try right-clicking an image, or a user control
like a button or a checkbox.  You may need to use Show All Available Commands
to see options other than <em>verifyTextPresent</em>. Once you select these other
options, the more commonly used ones will show up on the primary context menu.
For example, selecting <em>verifyElementPresent</em> for an image should later cause
that command to be available on the primary context menu the next time you
select an image and right-click.</p>
<p>Again, these commands will be explained in detail in the chapter on Selenium
commands.  For now though, feel free to use the IDE to record and select
commands into a script and then run the script.  You can learn a lot about
the Selenium commands simply by experimenting though the IDE.</p>

<h3>Editing<a class="headerlink" href="#editing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="insert-command">
<h4>Insert Command<a class="headerlink" href="#insert-command" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Select the point in your script where you want to insert the command.  Right-
click and select Insert Command.  Now use the command edit text fields to
enter your new command and its parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="insert-comment">
<h4>Insert Comment<a class="headerlink" href="#insert-comment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Comments may be added to make your script more readable.  These comments are
ignored when the script is run.  Select the point in your script where you
want to insert the comment.  Right-click and select Insert Comment.  Now use
the first command edit text fields to enter the comment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edit-a-command-or-comment">
<h4>Edit a Command or Comment<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-a-command-or-comment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Simply select the line to be changed and edit it using the command editing text

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="opening-and-saving-a-script">
<h3>Opening and Saving a Script<a class="headerlink" href="#opening-and-saving-a-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The File-»Open, Save and Save As menu commands behave similar to opening and
saving files in most other programs.  When you open an existing script, it
loads that script file into the IDE and displays its Selenium commands in the
main script editing window.</p>
<p>Notice also that you can open and save test suite files.  Test suites will be
discussed later in this section.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">At the time of writing there&#8217;s a bug, where at times, when the IDE is
first opened and then you select File-&gt;Open, nothing happens.  If you see
this, close down the IDE and restart it (you don&#8217;t need to close the
browser itself).  This will fix the problem.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-scripts">
<h2>Running Scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#running-scripts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The IDE allows many options for running your script. You can run a script all
at once, stop and start it, run it one line at a time, run a single command
you are current developing, and you can do a batch run of an entire test suite.
Execution of scripts is very flexible in the IDE.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Run a Script</dt>
<dd>Click the Run button to run the currently displayed script.</dd>
<dt>Run a Test Suite</dt>
<dd>Click the Run All button to run all the scripts in the currently loaded
test suite.</dd>
<dt>Stop and Start</dt>
<dd>The Pause button can be used to stop the script while it is running.  The
icon of this button then changes to indicate the Resume button.  To continue
click Resume.</dd>
<dt>Stop in the Middle</dt>
<dd>You can set a breakpoint in the script to cause the script to stop on a
particular command.  This is useful for debugging your script. To set a
breakpoint, select a command, right-click, and from the context menu
select Toggle Breakpoint.</dd>
<dt>Start from the Middle</dt>
<dd>You can tell the IDE to begin running from a specific command in the
middle of the script.  This also is used for debugging.  To set a
startpoint, select a command, right-click, and from the context menu
select Set/Clear Start Point.</dd>
<dt>Run Any Single Command</dt>
<dd>Double-click any single command to run it by itself.  This is useful when
writing a single command.  It lets you immediately test a command you are
constructing, but not sure if it is correct.  You can double-click it to
see if it runs correctly.  This is also available from the context menu.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugging">
<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Debugging means finding and fixing errors in your script.  This is a normal
part of script development.</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t teach debugging here as most new users to Selenium will already have
some basic experience with debugging.  If this is new to you, we recommend
you ask one of the developers in your organization.</p>
<div class="section" id="breakpoints-and-startpoints">
<h3>Breakpoints and Startpoints<a class="headerlink" href="#breakpoints-and-startpoints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Sel-IDE supports the setting of breakpoints and the ability to start and
stop the running of a script, from any point within the script.  That is, one
can run up to a specific command in the middle of the script and inspect how
the script behaves at that point.  To do this, set a breakpoint on the
command just before the one to be examined.</p>
<p>To set a breakpoint, select a command, right-click, and from the context menu
select <em>Toggle Breakpoint</em>.  Then click the Run button to run your script from
the beginning up to the breakpoint.</p>
<p>It is also sometimes useful to run a script from somewhere in the middle to
the end of the script or up to a breakpoint that follows the starting point.
For example, suppose your script first logs into the website and then
performs a series of tests and you are trying to debug one of those tests.
However, you only need to login once, but you need to keep rerunning your
tests as you are developing them.  You can login once, then run your script
from a startpoint placed after the login portion of your script.  That will
prevent you from having to manually logout each time you rerun your script.</p>
<p>To set a startpoint, select a command, right-click, and from the context
menu select <em>Set/Clear Start Point</em>.  Then click the Run button to execute the
script beginning at that startpoint.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stepping-through-a-script">
<h3>Stepping Through a Script<a class="headerlink" href="#stepping-through-a-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="section" id="find-button">
<h3>Find Button<a class="headerlink" href="#find-button" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Find button is used to see which UI element on the currently displayed
webpage (in the browser) is used in the currently selected Selenium command.
This is useful when building a locator for a command&#8217;s first parameter (see the
section on locators in the Selenium Commands chapter). It can be used with any
command that must identify a UI element on a webpage, i.e. <em>click</em>,
<em>clickAndWait</em>, <em>type</em>, and the <em>assert</em> and <em>verify</em> commands among others.</p>
<p>Select any command that must identify a UI element. Click the Find button.
Now look on the webpage displayed in the Firefox browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="page-source-for-debugging">
<h3>Page Source for Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#page-source-for-debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Often, when debugging a script, you simply must look at the page source (the
HTML for the webpage you&#8217;re trying to test) to determine a problem.  Firefox
makes this easy.  Simply, right-click the webpage and select Page Source.
The HTML opens in a separate window.  Use its Search feature (F3 function key)
to search for a keyword to find the HTML for the UI element you&#8217;re trying
to test.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-a-test-suite">
<h2>Writing a Test Suite<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-a-test-suite" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A test suite is a collection of test scripts and is displayed in the left-most
pane in the IDE. Test scripts may be added to the list and deleted from it.
Test suites may be opened and saved.  When a test suite is saved any changes
to tests scripts within that suite are also saved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-extensions">
<h2>User Extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#user-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>User extensions are javascript files that allow one to create their own
customized and features to add additional functionality.  Often this is in
the form of customized commands although this extensibility is not limited to
additional commands.  User extensions are loaded by setting the path to user
extension files through the Options menu.</p>
<p>There are a number of useful extensions created by users available at the
SeleniumHQ website. Also you&#8217;ll find information on writing your own extensions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="format">
<h2>Format<a class="headerlink" href="#format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Format, under the Options menu, allows you to select a language for saving
and displaying the script.  This is for supporting Selenium-RC.  The default
is HTML and if you will only be running your Selenium scripts from the IDE
you can ignore this feature.</p>
<p>If, however, you will be using Selenium-RC to run your scripts, this is how
you translate your test script into a programming language.  Select the
language, i.e. Java, PHP, you will be using with Selenium-RC for developing
your test programs.  This simply save the scripts using File-»Save.  Your
script will be translated into a series of functions in the language you
choose.  Essentially, program code supporting your test is generated for you
by Selenium-IDE.</p>
<p>Also, note that if the generated code does not suit your needs, you can alter
it by editing a configuration file which defines the generation process.
Each supported language has configuration settings which are editable.  This
is under Options-&gt;Options-&gt;Format tab.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">At the time of writing, this feature is not yet supported by the Selenium
developers.  However the author has altered the C# format in a limited
manner and it has worked well.</p>
