Getting Help 
============

If you find any problems using Selenium, there are several places where you can
search for help and where volunteers like you and me will spend their time 
trying to help you save yours.

User Forums 
-----------

The first place where people ask for help about Selenium are the `Official 
Forums`_. Here, you'll find that most of the times, someone already found the
problem you are facing right now, and usually they had reached the solution
you are looking for.

Off course, if you can't find any previous solution to your problem, you can
always create an account in the forums and start your own thread asking for 
help.

.. note:: Please make sure to look in the forums before asking for something.
   It's very frustrating for the people that's reading and helping others to
   find that you didn't even put the effort of searching for the solution on
   your own.

Chat Room
---------

Though the best place to ask for help are the forums (because they also keep the
information accessible for others to read it in the future). If you have a very
important (or too simple) issue that needs a solution ASAP, you can always enter
to the IRC chat room. You will always find someone ready to help on *#selenium at
Freenode* (irc.freenode.net).
