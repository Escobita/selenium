<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Test Automation for Web Applications</a></h1>
<p>Many, perhaps most, software applications these days are written as web-
based applications to be run in an Internet browser.  The efficiency and
effectiveness of testing these applications varies widely among companies and
organizations.  In the era of continuously improving software processes
promoting methodologies such as eXtreme programming  (XP) and Agile practices
it can be argued that disciplined testing and quality assurance practices are
still underdeveloped in many organizations.  Software testing is still often
conducted manually. At times, this is effective. However there are many
options to manual testing and many organizations are often not aware of, or
not skilled in, developing these options that would greatly improve the
efficiency of their software development by adding efficiencies to there
testing.</p>
<p>Test automation is often the answer.  Test automation means using software
to run tests against other software. In other words, one uses a software
program to automatically run the tests against the application to be tested
.  Essentially, what would be conducted manually by an end-user or test
engineer is built into a program.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to automating testing. Most are related to
the repeatability of the tests and the speed that the tests can be executed
.  There are a number of commercial and open source tools available for
assisting with the development of test automation. Selenium, is possibly the
most widely-used open source solution. This user's guide is to introduce
the new Selenium user to Selenium, along with providing advice in best
practices accumulated from the Selenium community.</p>
<p>This guide will assist both new and experienced Selenium users in
effective techniques in building test automation. Many examples are provided.
Also technical information on the internal structure of Selenium and
recommended uses of Selenium is provided as contributed by a consortium of
experienced Selenium users. It is our hope that this user guide will get
additional new users excited about using Selenium to build test automation.
We hope this guide will assist &quot;getting the word out&quot; that quality assurance
and software testing has many options that often organizations are unaware of
. We hope this user's guide and Selenium itself provide a valuable aid to
boosting the reader's efficiency in the software testing processes.</p>

<div class="section" id="id1">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Introducing Selenium</a></h1>
<p>Selenium is a robust set of tools that support rapid development of test
automation for web-based applications. Selenium is highly extensible,
allowing the developer of test automation unlimited option in testing logic
and defect reporting by supporting multiple programming languages. Selenium
provides a rich set of testing functions, specifically geared to the needs
of function testing a web application. These functions also are highly
extensible, allowing many options for locating UI elements and comparing
expected test results against actual application behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="to-automate-or-not-to-automate-that-is-a-question">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">To Automate or Not to Automate -- That is a Question!</a></h1>
<p>Is automation always an advantage? When should one decide to automate their
testcases? It is not always advantageous to automate testcases. There are
times when manual testing may be more appropriate. For instance, if the
application's user interface will change considerably in the near future,
then any automation would need to be rewritten. Also, sometimes there simply
is not enough time to build test automation. For the short-term, manual testing
is more effective. If an application has a very tight deadline, there is
currently no test automation available, and it's imperative that the testing
get done within that time frame, then manual testing is the best solution.</p>
<p>Test automation has it's place though, and has specific advantages for
improving the long-term efficiency of a software team's testing processes.
Test automation supports</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>frequent and rapid regression testing</li>
<li>rapid feedback to developers during, and parallel to, the development process</li>
<li>unlimited test-pass iteration</li>
<li>customized reporting of application defects</li>
<li>support for Agile, eXtreme development methodologies</li>
<li>disciplined documentation of testcases.</li>
<li>uncovering the defects.</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: expand on the points a bit more. -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="selenium-components">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Selenium Components</a></h1>
<p>Selenium is composed of three major components.  Each has a specific role in
aiding the development of web apps test automation.</p>
<div class="section" id="selenium-ide">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Selenium IDE</a></h2>
<p>The Selenium IDE is the integrated development environment for building
Selenium test scripts.  It operates as a Firefox plug-in.  The Selenium-IDE
provides an easy to use interface for both developing and running testcases.
It also can run an entire test suite.  The Selenium-IDE has a recording
feature for recording user actions into a script as the user performs them.
It also has an options menu (right-click) integrated with the Firefox browser
which allows the user to pick from a list of assertions and verifications
based on a currently selected UI component and then add the selected test to
their script.  The IDE predicts the assertions and verifications desired by
the script developer based on the context of the currently selected UI element
.  Finally, the IDE allows unlimited editing of the chosen script commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selenium-rc">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Selenium RC</a></h2>
<p>Selenium RC is the primary way most Selenium users run their tests. It allows
the test automation developer to use a programming language for maximum
flexibility and extensibility in developing test logic.  For instance, if the
application under test returns a result set, and if the automated test program
needs to run tests on each element in the result set, the programming languages
iteration support can be used to iterate through the result set, calling
Selenium commands to run tests on each result set item.</p>
<!-- Dave: I think an example would be a good idea here so that the reader can
immediately see the advantage of using Selenium RC. Maybe some pseudo code. -->
<p>Selenium-RC supports the use of programming languages for test logic by
providing a programming API and library for each of it's 8 supported languages.
This ability to use Selenium-RC to develop a test program also allows the automated
testing to be integrated with a project's automated build environment.</p>
<!-- TODO: double-check this -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="selenium-grid">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Selenium Grid</a></h2>
<p>Selenium Grid extends Selenium RC's capabilities by supporting the execution
of automated tests against multiple browsers and multiple machines supporting
multiple test environments.</p>
<!-- TODO: Research this and expand this section. -->
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supported-browsers">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Supported Browsers</a></h1>
<p>At the time of writing, the soon-to-be-released Selenium 1.0 supports Internet
Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera And Safari</p>
<!-- TODO: look this up and get the specific versions off SeleniumHQ.org -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="flexibility-and-extensibility">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Flexibility and Extensibility</a></h1>
<p>You'll find that Selenium is highly flexible and easy to extend by adding your
own functionality.  Selenium-RC support for multiple programming and scripting
languages allows the test writer to build any logic they need into their
automated testing.</p>
<p>Selenium-IDE allows for the addition of user-defined user-extensions for
creating additional commands customized to the user's needs.  Finally, a future
goal of the Selenium project is to allow the user to re-configure how the
Selenium-IDE generates its Selenium-RC code.  This would allow the user to
customize the generated code to fit in with their own customized test framework.
Finally, Selenium is fully an Open Source project where enhancements can be
submitted for contribution.</p>
<!-- Can I make this statement?  If so, how should I reword this? -->
<div class="section" id="example-web-site-test">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Example Web-Site Test</a></h2>
<!-- To be determined, based on other examples occurring later in the doc.
Do we even need a sample website introduced this early?  Possibly not.
We can either have a sample website used through the book for illustrations,
or just do different examples at each point where an example is needed.
We'll figure that out as this doc progresses. -->
<!-- Santiago: Maybe we can create a sample website, where users can practice on tests
creation and we can base our examples on. I have a basic AJAX webapp that
I developed in PHP for college, it has a CRUD and a contact form. I'll take
a look at it and post it for you to see it. -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-this-book">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">About this Book</a></h2>
<p>This book targets both new users of Selenium and those who have been using
Selenium and are seeking additional knowledge. It serves to introduce the new
user to Selenium test automation and to test automation in general. However
the experienced Selenium user will also find this book valuable. It compiles
in one place a set of useful Selenium techniques and best practices by drawing
from the knowledge of multiple experience Selenium QA professionals.</p>
<p>The remaining chapters of the book present the following:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Selenium Basics</dt>
<dd>Introduces Selenium by describing how to select the Selenium component
appropriate for your own testing tasks. Also provides a general
description of Selenium commands and syntax. This section allows you to
get a general feel for how Selenium approaches test automation and aims to
help you decide where to start.</dd>
<dt>Selenium Commands</dt>
<dd>Describes the Selenium commands in detail providing many examples. This
chapter shows the full extent of what types of actions, verifications and
assertions can be made against a web application.</dd>
<dt>Selenium IDE</dt>
<dd>Explains how to build test scripts using the Selenium Integrated Development
Environment.  This chapter also describes useful techniques for making your
scripts more easily readable when interpreting defaults caught by your
automated testing. In this section we explain how your test script can be
&quot;exported&quot; to the programming language of your choice. Finally, this section
describes some configurations available for extending and customizing how
the Selenium-IDE supports script development.</dd>
<dt>Selenium-RC</dt>
<dd>Explains how to develop an automated test program using the Selenium-RC API.
Many examples are presented in both, a programming language and a scripting
language. The installing of Selenium-RC is covered here.  The various modes,
or configurations, that Selenium-RC supports are described along with their
trade-offs and limitations. Architecture diagrams are provided to help
illustrate these points.  Also in this section a number of solutions to
problems often difficult for the new user are described in this chapter. This
includes handling Security Certificates, https requests, Pop-ups and the
opening of new windows.</dd>
<dt>Test Design Considerations</dt>
<dd>Presents many useful techniques for using Selenium efficiently. This
includes scripting techniques and programming techniques for use with
Selenium-RC. We cover examples of source code showing how to report defects
in the application under test. We also cover techniques commonly asked about
in the user forums such as how to implement data-driven tests (tests where
one can vary the data between different test passes).</dd>
</dl>
<!-- TODO: Need to look at the TOC and expand this paragraph a little. -->
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Advanced Topics</dt>
<dd>presents a number of advanced topics geared to the experienced Selenium
user.</dd>
</dl>
<!-- TODO: Need to look at the TOC and see what we put here.  Add another
sentence or two describing this section. -->
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Getting Help</dt>
