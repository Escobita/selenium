	<p>Getting involved with Selenium is easy: just email us on the mailing lists or forums and we'll work with you on how to best capture your willingness to help out.  OpenQA is a loose collection of QA-related projects, many focussing on Selenium, and you could get involved with any individually project that interests you. Start with the forums, and work out what is best for you.</p>
	<p><br>
	  Ultimately, the best way to get involved is to contributing code. Providing patches with your bug reports will definitely get them resolved sooner and will ultimately lead to getting you invited to be a developer for the project. We also greatly appreciate:</p>

    <h2>Help in the forums</h2>
    <p>The Selenium  <a href="http://clearspace.openqa.org/">forums</a> constantly have a lot of newbie questions. We're pretty open to help in those forums answering questions, so please dive in as you like.</p>
    <h2>Writing documentation</h2>
    <p>For the most part our documentation is held in source control, on the wiki, or generated as part of the build(s). The main documentation is in plain HTML so use your favorite editor offline to edit the pages. The source for this main site is <a href="https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-core/selenium-website/src/main/webapp">here</a> and if your are familiar with Subversion you should be able to bring it down to your local system for offline editing.</p>  The subversion source for documentation for the others is like so: <a href="http://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-core/website/src/main/webapp/">here</a> for Selenium Core, <a href="http://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-rc/website/src/main/webapp">here</a> for Selenium Remote-Control, <a href="https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-ide/website/src/main/webapp/">here</a> for Selenium IDE, and <a href="https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-grid/website/src/main/webapp/">here</a> for Selenium Grid.</p>  
    <h2>Bug reports</h2>
    <p>We encourage people to file bug reports for Selenium for things that go wrong for them. See <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/support/">for more details</a>. In many cases the bug reports are the result of not being familiar with the way Selenium works, is installed or its limitations.  We would love additional help going through the bug reports and adding comments (which automatically get sent to the reporter) for cases where advice is all they need.  Alternatively, if you're coder and are skilled in the language in question, then dive in and see if you can fix the bug.</p>
    <h2>Patches</h2>
    <p>Patches are the life blood of vibrant open source project.  The Selenium developers on the project today have donated patches initially to get there.  Many have stuck around, but as many only donated one or two patches which is fine by us too.  The subversion source-code roots for projects are like so: <a href="http://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-core/trunk">here</a> for Selenium Core, <a href="http://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-rc/trunk">here</a> for Selenium Remote-Control, <a href="https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-ide/trunk">here</a> for Selenium IDE, and <a href="https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-grid/trunk">here</a> for Selenium Grid.  Some of these will require Maven to be installed to kick off the build, and some will require Ant.</p>
    <h2>Feature requests</h2>
    <p>As for bugs, feature requests are filed through <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/support/">the support page</a>.  Please be detailed for feature requests and also look to see whether they have been filed before.
