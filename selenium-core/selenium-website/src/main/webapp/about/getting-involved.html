  <h2>Getting Involved with Selenium</h2>

  <p>Selenium is certainly a team effort! There are several ways
  you can help out, whether you're a programmer, designer, QA
  engineer, writer, project manager, or just willing to help. If
  you're interested in helping, the best way to connect with us is
  in the forums, in the <a href=
  "http://clearspace.openqa.org/community/selenium/developers">Selenium
  Developers</a> section. We'll work with you to get you set up to
  contribute.</p>

  <p>You can help by...</p>

  <h3>Answering questions in the <a href=
  "http://clearspace.openqa.org/community/selenium">forums</a></h3>

  <p><em>For anyone interested in helping</em></p>

  <p>We get a lot of questions and we have a great community to
  help answer them. If you could <a href=
  "http://www.openqa.org/sass/index.action">register</a> and log
  into the <a href=
  "http://clearspace.openqa.org/community/selenium">forums</a> to
  answer a question or two, that would be great! There are often
  some very basic questions that are easy to answer.</p>

  <h3>Updating our website</h3>

  <p><em>For writers, designers, and programmers with Selenium
  experience</em></p>

  <p>We have a lot of out-of-date information that needs to be
  tidied up on the site! Help by writing documentation, producing
  helpful diagrams, re-skinning the website, or organizing
  content.</p>

  <p>You can get started by using Subversion to check out our
  content at <a href=
  "https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-core/selenium-website">https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-core/selenium-website</a>.
  To get it running, you'll want to install a recent version of
  Java (if you don't have it already) and <a href=
  "http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>, which is used to
  build the website and run it in a web server called "Jetty."
  (Maven will download Jetty when it's needed.) Once you have it
  installed, run "mvn jetty:run" to start up Maven and Jetty and
  you'll have a website live on your computer at <a href=
  "http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>. If you're on
  Windows, you may want to make a batch script like this:</p>
  <pre>
        SET JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02
        SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\apache-maven-2.0.9\bin
        mvn jetty:run
        
</pre>and then save it to the selenium-website folder. (Maven uses
the pom.xml configuration file there to set everything up.)

  <p>Get involved by posting to the <a href=
  "http://clearspace.openqa.org/community/selenium/developers">Selenium
  Developers</a> section of the forums.</p>

  <h3>Writing documentation</h3>

  <p><em>For writers with Selenium experience</em></p>

  <p>For the most part our documentation is held in source control,
  on the wiki, or generated as part of the build(s). The main
  documentation is in plain HTML so use your favorite editor
  offline to edit the pages. The source for this main site is
  <a href=
  "https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-core/selenium-website/src/main/webapp">
  here</a> and if you are familiar with Subversion you should be
  able to bring it down to your local system for offline
  editing.</p>You can also help with the documentation of <a href=
  "http://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-core/website/src/main/webapp/">
  Selenium Core</a>, <a href=
  "http://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-rc/website/src/main/webapp">Selenium
  RemoteControl</a>, <a href=
  "https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-ide/website/src/main/webapp/">
  Selenium IDE</a>, and <a href=
  "https://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-grid/website/src/main/webapp/">
  Selenium Grid</a>. (See above for how to set up Maven and Jetty
  locally to try it out on your own computer.)

  <h3>Bug reports and feature requests</h3>

  <p><em>For any Selenium user</em></p>

  <p>If you ran into a problem with Selenium, feel free to file a
  bug report about it. See our <a href=
  "http://selenium.openqa.org/support/">support</a> site.
  Similarly, if you have an idea for a feature you'd like to see in
  a future version, report that as well.</p>

  <p>You may also want to check the <a href=
  "http://clearspace.openqa.org/community/selenium">forums</a> to
  see if a similar question has been asked. In many cases the bug
  reports are the result of not being familiar with the way
  Selenium works, is installed or its limitations. We would love
  help going through the bug reports and adding comments (which
  automatically get sent to the reporter) for cases where advice is
  all they need.</p>

  <p>If you're a programmer and are skilled in the language in
  question, then dive in and see if you can fix the bug. (See
  below.)</p>

  <h3>Contributing code to Selenium</h3>

  <p><em>For programmers with Selenium experience</em></p>

  <p>Much of the magic behind Selenium is the hard work of
  programmers with backgrounds in Javascript, Java, Ruby, PHP,
  Python, perl, C#, HTML, and other languages. If you haven't
  already, you can download the source code from our Subversion
  repositories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href=
    "http://svn.seleniumhq.org/svn/selenium-core">http://svn.seleniumhq.org/svn/selenium-core</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "http://svn.seleniumhq.org/svn/selenium-rc">http://svn.seleniumhq.org/svn/selenium-rc</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "http://svn.seleniumhq.org/svn/selenium-ide">http://svn.seleniumhq.org/svn/selenium-ide</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "http://svn.seleniumhq.org/svn/selenium-grid">http://svn.seleniumhq.org/svn/selenium-grid</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We encourage code patches and other contributions - get
  involved by posting to the <a href=
  "http://clearspace.openqa.org/community/selenium/developers">Selenium
  Developers</a> section of the forums.</p>

  <h3>Shaping the <a href="roadmap.html">vision for
  Selenium</a></h3>

  <p><em>For project managers, QA Engineers, designers, and
  programmers</em></p>

  <p>How could we make Selenium better? What would increase its
  value to end users and help it be more accessible and practical?
