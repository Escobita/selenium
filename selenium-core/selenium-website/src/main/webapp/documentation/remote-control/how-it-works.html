  <h1><b>How Selenium Remote Control works</b></h1>

  <p>The Selenium Server communicates directly with the browser
  using AJAX (XmlHttpRequest). You can send commands directly to
  the Server using simple HTTP GET/POST requests; that means that
  you can use any programming language that can make HTTP requests
  to automate Selenium tests on the browser. To further ease this
  process, we provide wrapper objects for a number of mainstream
  programming languages (Java, .NET, Perl, Python, and Ruby).</p>

  <p>Finally, the Selenium Server acts as a client-configured HTTP
  proxy, to stand in between the browser and your website. This
  allows a Selenium-enabled browser to run JavaScript on arbitrary
  websites.</p>

  <p>Here is an architectural diagram.</p><img style=

  "selenium-rc-detailed.png"><br>
  As a test suite starts in your favorite language, the following
  happens<br>

  <ol>
    <li>The client/driver reaches out to the selenium-server.</li>

    <li>Selenium-Server launches a browser (or reuses an old one)
    with a URL that will load Selenium core web page.</li>

    <li>Selenium-Core gets the first instruction from the
    client/driver (via the HTTP Proxy built into the Selenium RC
    Server.</li>

    <li>Selenim-Core acts on that first instruction, typlically
    opening a page of the AUT.</li>

    <li>the web server is asked for that page, and it renders in
    the frame/window reserved for it.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Variations&nbsp;</h2>Some teams choose to have the web server
  launched in the same process that is driving the tests.
  &nbsp;That will most likely mean that the web-app technology is
  compatible with the testing logic. &nbsp;JSP and JUnit for
  example.
