  <h3><a name="java5" id="java5">When first starting the server, I
  get this error message: "(Unsupported major.minor version
  49.0)"</a></h3><a name="java5" id="java5">This is Java's
  extremely unhelpful error message telling you that you're not
  using the correct version of Java. The Selenium Server requires
  Java 1.5 or higher; this typically happens when you use Java 1.4
  instead of 1.5. Try running this from the command line:</a>

  <blockquote>
    <code><a name="java5" id="java5">java -version</a></code>
  </blockquote>

  <p><a name="java5" id="java5">You should see a brief message
  telling you what version of Java is installed, like this:</a></p>

  need to add it to your PATH environment variable.

  <h3><a name="404">During the tutorial, I get a 404 error when
  running the getNewBrowserSession command!</a></h3>

  <p><a name="404">First, finish reading the</a> <a href=
  "tutorial.html">tutorial</a>. Make sure you read the section
  about the "Same Origin Policy" carefully.</p>

  <p>If you're getting a 404 error while attempting to open a page
  on "http://www.google.com/selenium-server/", then it must be
  because the Selenium Server was not correctly configured as a
  proxy. Remember, that directory doesn't really exist on
  google.com; it only appears to exist when the proxy is properly
  configured.</p>

  <p>Now the question to ask is: <i>why isn't my proxy properly
  configured</i>? There are a number of possible reasons, depending
  on which way you launched your browser: with *firefox, *iexplore,
  *opera, or *custom.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>*iexplore</b>: If you launched your browser using
      *iexplore, there are a number of likely possibilities.

      <p>Selenium Server attempts to configure the global proxy
      settings in your Internet Options control panel; we need to
      make sure that those are correctly configured when Selenium
      Server launches the browser. Try looking at your Internet
      Options control panel. Click on the "Connections" tab and
      click on "LAN Settings".</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you have checked "Automatically detect settings",
        (the top check box,) you'll need to uncheck it before using
        Selenium RC. This is filed as bug <a href=
        "http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SRC-22">SRC-22</a>.

          <p>If you need to use a proxy to access the application
          you want to test, you'll need to start Selenium Server
          with "-Dhttp.proxyHost"; see the <a href=
          "options.html">command line options</a> for more
          details.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Also note, as this Control Panel states, that "these
        settings will not apply to dial-up or VPN connections". If
        you're on a dial-up or VPN connection, Selenium RC cannot
        automatically configure the IE proxy... in fact, as far as
        we know, there's no standard way to configure your proxy at
        all, even manually! (This is filed as bug <a href=
        "http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SRC-21">SRC-21</a>, but it
        may not be possible to fix it.) As a workaround, you may be
        able to use the <a href="experimental.html">experimental
        *iehta browser launcher</a> instead.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As a last resort, you may try configuring your proxy
      manually and then launching your browser with <a href=
      "#custom">*custom</a>, or with our <a href=
      "experimental.html">experimental *iehta browser
      launcher</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>*custom</b>: When using *custom, it's up to you to
      configure the proxy correctly (manually). If you forgot to do
      this, or if you configured the proxy incorrectly, you'll get
      a 404 error. Double-check that you've configured your proxy
      settings correctly. Note that in some browsers it's very easy
      to make a mistake and change the wrong settings, thinking
      that you've configured your proxy, when you've really had no
      effect at all.

      <p>One way to tell whether you've configured your proxy
      correctly is to attempt to intentionally configure your
      browser <i>incorrectly</i>. Try configuring your browser to
      use the wrong proxy server hostname, or the wrong port. If
      you've successfully configured your browser's proxy settings
      <i>incorrectly</i>, your browser will be unable to connect to
      the Internet, which is one way to make sure you're adjusting
      the relevant settings.</p>

      <p>For example, you might try configuring your browser to use
      the proxy server "asdflkjdasf" on port "1234". Then try
      connecting to google.com in the ordinary way, and doing a
      search. If you connect successfully to google.com, then you
      must not have really changed your proxy settings at all! You
      might also try turning your Selenium Server off while using
      the correct settings (localhost on port 4444). You should not
      be able to connect to Google if your proxy is disabled. If it
      seems like you can, then you know you've almost certainly
      made a mistake.</p>

      <p>Note that this problem can be especially troublesome on
      Internet Explorer, which can sometimes ignore whatever proxy
      settings are configured, even manually! (This normally
      happens when you're using a dial-up Internet connection, or
      if you're using a VPN.) In that case, you may not be able to
      configure your proxy at all. As a workaround, you may be able
      to use the <a href="experimental.html">experimental *iehta
      browser launcher</a> instead.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>SSL/HTTPS</b>: If you attempt to start a browser session
    on an HTTPS URL, we will try to use our proxy to intercept
    these encrypted instructions. See the section on <a href=
    "tutorial.html#https">HTTPS in the tutorial</a>. This may cause
    your browser to spawn a pop-up warning you that someone may be
    intercepting your secure transaction; in this case, that is
    actually happening. Our proxy is forging SSL credentials and
    trying to make your browser accept them. (We hope to one day to
    be able to automatically configure browsers not to present
    these warnings.) In the meantime, if our built-in SSL support
    doesn't work for you, you'll have to use one of our <a href=
    "experimental.html">experimental browser launchers</a> to test
    sites that require HTTPS support.</li>

    <li><b>others (*firefox, *opera)</b>: For the others, we
    automatically hard-code the proxy for you, and don't know of
    any known issues with this functionality. If you're
    encountering 404 errors in the tutorial while using these
    browser launchers, post them to our <a href=
    "userForums.jsp">user forums</a>... they might be bugs!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="google" id="google">During the tutorial, I can't
  access Google when running the "open" command!</a></h3>

  <p><a name="google" id="google">First, finish reading the</a>
  <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>. Make sure you read the
  section about the "Same Origin Policy" carefully.</p>

  <p>There's a couple of possible reasons this might be
  happening:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>This might be a simple issue where you've mistyped the
    commands. Make sure you type the commands exactly as they
    appear in the tutorial.</li>

    <li>Selenium RC automatically configures the browser to use the
    Selenium Server as a proxy. But if you need to use another
    proxy to access the Internet, then you may not be able to
    access Google while using the Selenium Server as a proxy. (The
    Selenium Server will not automatically use your proxy; it will
    attempt to contact Google directly.)

      <p>If you need to use a proxy to access the application you
      want to test, you'll need to start Selenium Server with
      "-Dhttp.proxyHost"; see the <a href="options.html">command
      line options</a> for more details.</p>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="permission-denied" id="permission-denied">Why am I
  getting a Permission Denied error when using Selenium
  RC?</a></h3><a name="permission-denied" id=
  "permission-denied"></a>

  <p><a name="permission-denied" id="permission-denied">This
  usually happens because you have run afoul of the</a> <a href=
  "tutorial.html#sameorigin">Same Origin Policy</a>. If your
  browser session starts on one origin, but then you attempt to
  load up a page from another origin (with a different domain,
  protocol or port), you'll run into these Permission Denied
  errors.</p>

  <p>In most cases, you can remedy this just by making sure that
  your browser session starts on the right origin. You can't test
  www.google.com from a browser session starting at google.com, so
  you'll just need to start your browser session differently.</p>

  <p>If for some reason you absolutely need to be able to access
  websites on multiple domains, then right now the only way to do
  that is to use one of our <a href=
  "experimental.html">experimental browser launchers</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="custom" id="custom">Selenium Server launches the
  browser in just one particular configuration (pop-ups blocked,
  etc.). I need to test running the browser in a different
  configuration. How do I do that?</a></h3>

  <p><a name="custom" id="custom">Normally Selenium RC
  automatically configures your browser, but if you launch your
  browser using "*custom" as your browser launcher, you can force
  Selenium RC to launch the browser as-is, without changing your
  configuration. (Note that this is also the way you launch other
  browsers that Selenium RC doesn't yet explicitly
  support.)</a></p><a name="custom" id="custom">For example, you
  can launch Firefox with a custom configuration like this:</a>

  <blockquote>
    <a name="custom" id="custom"></a>

    <p><code><a name="custom" id=
    "custom">cmd=getNewBrowserSession&amp;1=<strong>*custom
    c:\Program Files\Mozilla
    Firefox\firefox.exe</strong>&amp;2=http://www.google.com</a></code></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><a name="custom" id="custom">Note that when we launch the
  browser in this way, you'll have to <em>manually</em> configure
  your browser to use the Selenium Server as a proxy. (Normally
  this just means opening your browser preferences and specifying
  "localhost:4444" as an HTTP proxy, but instructions for this can
  differ radically from browser to browser, so consult your
  browser's documentation for details.)</a></p>

  <p><a name="custom" id="custom">Beware that Mozilla browsers can
  be a little fidgety about how they start and stop. You may need
  to set the MOZ_NO_REMOTE environment variable to make Mozilla
  browsers behave a little more predictably. Unix users should
  avoid launching your browser using a shell script; always prefer
  to use the binary executable (e.g. firefox-bin) directly.</a></p>

  <p><a name="custom" id="custom">If you attempt to launch a
  *custom browser but don't configure the proxy correctly, you
  won't be able to get through even a simple Google test, because
  you'll get a 404 (File not found) error trying to access
  http://www.google.com/selenium-server/. Remember, that directory
  doesn't really exist on Google.com; it only appears to exist when
  the proxy is properly configured. If you get this error,
  double-check that you've configured your proxy settings
  correctly. Note that in some browsers it's very easy to make a
  mistake and change the wrong settings, thinking that you've
  configured your proxy, when you've really had no effect at
  all.</a></p>

  <p><a name="custom" id="custom">One way to tell whether you've
  configured your proxy correctly is to attempt to intentionally
  configure your browser <i>incorrectly</i>. Try configuring your
  browser to use the wrong proxy server hostname, or the wrong
  port. If you've successfully configured your browser's proxy
  settings <i>incorrectly</i>, your browser will be unable to
  connect to the Internet, which is one way to make sure you're
  adjusting the relevant settings.</a></p>

  You should not be able to connect to Google if your proxy is

  <h3><a name="linux" id="linux">On Linux, why isn't my Firefox
  browser session closing?</a></h3>

  <p><a name="linux" id="linux">On Unix/Linux we need to invoke
  "firefox-bin" directly, so make sure <i>that</i> executable is on
  the path. If we're forced to execute Firefox through a shell
  script, when it comes time to kill the browser Selenium RC will
  kill the shell script, leaving the browser running.</a></p>

  <p><a name="linux" id="linux">If necessary, you can specify the
  path to firefox-bin directly, like this:</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <a name="linux" id="linux"></a>

    <p><code><a name="linux" id=
    "linux">cmd=getNewBrowserSession&amp;1=<strong>*firefox
    /usr/local/firefox/firefox-bin</strong>&amp;2=http://www.google.com</a></code></p>
