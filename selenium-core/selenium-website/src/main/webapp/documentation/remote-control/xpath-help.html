  <title>Help with XPath</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>XPath is as useful for Selenium-RC as it is for Selenium-Core.
  &nbsp;You can use the same techniques for evolving XPath
  expressions for testing with RC. Read the <a href=
  "/projects/core/xpath-help.html">XPath Help</a></p>page for Core.

  <h2>Using XPath Checker and Firebug with RC</h2>

  <p>Selenium-RC launches its own Firefox browser, without the
  plugins you may have installed for your Firefox. &nbsp;You can
  hack Selenium-RC to put in Firebug and XPath Checker. You may be
  in the habit of pausing tests in the middle of a run, and kicking
  off&nbsp;Firebug so you can confirm XPATH for certain widgets,
  fields, etc.</p>

  <h3>Firebug</h3>

  <p>Instructions here are for a Mac, with Firebug already
  installed into Firefox.<br>
  <br>
  Start&nbsp;in the dir that you have the Selenium-RC server jar
  in.&nbsp; And run these commands in order to add Firebug to that
  jar in the right way (change <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">STUPID-PROFILE-ID</span> to be whatever
  Firefox has set your random profile ID):</p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
mkdir foo<br>mkdir foo/customProfileDirCUSTFFCHROME<br>mkdir foo/customProfileDirCUSTFFCHROME/extensions<br>cp -R ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/<span style="font-weight: bold;">STUPID-PROFILE-ID</span>/extensions/firebug\@software.joehewitt.com foo/customProfileDirCUSTFFCHROME/extensions/<br>cd foo/<br>cp -R foo/customProfileDirCUSTFFCHROME foo/customProfileDirCUSTFF<br>jar -uf ../selenium-server-<span style="font-weight: bold;">x.y</span>-standalone.jar  .
</pre>

  <p>If you're not on a mac, then modify the above to make sense
  for your operating system.</p>

  <h3>XPath Checker</h3>Brian has a small bug in the naming of his
  plugin, so that its a little harder to copy into Selenium-RC<br>
  <br>
  (TODO)<br>
