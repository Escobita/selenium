	<p>Getting involved with Selenium is easy: just email us on the mailing lists or forums and we'll work with you on how to best capture your willingness to help out.  OpenQA is a loose collection of QA-related projects, many focussing on Selenium, and you could get invovled with any individually project that interests you. Start with the forums, and work out what is best for you.</p>

	  Ultimately, the best way to get involved is to put your money where you mouth is - by contributing code. Providing patches with your bug reports will definitely get them resolved sooner and will certainly lead to getting you on board as a developer for the project. We also greatly appreciate:</p>
