<h1 class="first">Selenium Overview</h1>
<p>
<b>Selenium</b> is a test tool for web applications.
Selenium tests run
<b>directly in a browser</b>, just as real users do. And
they run in
Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Firefox on Windows, Linux, and
Macintosh. &nbsp;We have plans to target the Safari on the iPhone
and
others later.&nbsp;
</p>
There are two modes of operation for <span style="font-style: italic;">Selenium Core</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Selenium Remote Control (RC)</span><br>
<h2>Selenium Core</h2>
Core mode - the JavaScript core library and the tests in question are
loaded <span style="font-weight: bold;">into</span>
your webapp. Its a simpler form of Selenium, and suitable for
non-developers, but it has some inherant limitations. &nbsp;Below
is a
simplified representation of the architecture. <br>

<h2>Selenium Remote Control</h2>
The
Remote Control mode is more advanced. It is able to test a wider range
of web-applications than Selenium-Core and is more scalable, but
requires some technical knowledge to set up. &nbsp;Below is a
simplified architectural representation of it .. <br>

<div style="text-align: left; margin-right: 120px; margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Considering the simplicity of
it, it is
almost surprising that no one has thought of doing this previously. The
framework is simple and the code is neat and very maintainable.
Sometimes it takes a work of genius to find the uncomplicated solution
to a potentially complicated problem.</span><span style="font-style: italic;">" - </span><a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/blog/2">Antony

<div style="text-align: left; margin-right: 120px;">Selenium
was
developed by team
of developers and testers at
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>.
It is
open-source software and can
be downloaded and used without charge. It is currently under active
development developers from multiple companies. Stay tuned for updates
and further
announcements. <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>
is a leader in Agile development methods for enterprise
software development. Selenium is designed specifically for the
acceptance testing requirements of Agile teams. However, teams
using more traditional development will also find it useful.
