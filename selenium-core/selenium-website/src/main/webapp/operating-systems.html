	<p>Selenium has been designed for Windows, Macintosh, BSD and Solaris.</p>
	<p>The core mode of Selenium should more than those, but the Remote Control mode depends on two things.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>The availablility Java (JDK 5.0+) for it to run.</li>
	  <li>An understanding from the Selenium team of how to launch a browser from the command line.</li>
    </ol>
	<p>Selenium's own build is tested against Windows, Mac and Linux. We reply on user feedback to notify us of problems for BSD and Solaris where applicable, but have experienced good compatibility over the years.</p>
	<p>We're keen on integrating as many as possible - and looking for volunteers to help.</p>
	<p>(TODO)</p>
