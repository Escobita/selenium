	<p>Selenium Core and IDE uses a simple language based on a series of commands :</p>
	<pre>open /seach.html<br>type searchField Cheese<br>click submit<br>verifyTextPresent Cheddar
</pre>
	<p>These prove peopular for non-professional programmers.</p>
	<p>Selenium Remote Control (RC) uses real programming languages, like Java, Ruby, Python, C#, Perl, PHP :</p>
	<p>(Java)</p>
	<pre>selenium.open(&quot;/search.html&quot;);<br>selenium.type(&quot;searchField&quot;, &quot;Cheese&quot;);<br>selenium.click(&quot;submit&quot;);<br>selenium.verifyTextPresent(&quot;Cheddar&quot;);</pre>
	<p></p>
	<p>Selenium-IDE  can save scripts to one of the other languages in order to kick-start the development of full RC suites of tests. It is a good bridge from the world of business-analysts, customers, end-users and project managers to developers. Meaning the the former group find it easy to record the situation that represents a defect in the application, play it back, then pass it to the developers to fix.  </p>
