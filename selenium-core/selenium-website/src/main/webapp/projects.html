	<p>Selenium is many related projects.</p>
	<p>Common to all is Selenium core, which delivers the basic functionality of testing web applications in a browser</p>
	<p>Selenium Remote Control (RC) takes the Selenium idea and allow browsers to be controlled from industry standard languages</p>
	<p>Selenium Grid allows RC nodes to be organised into a larger multi-machine structure to run multiple tests in parallel.</p>
	<p>Selenium-IDE plugs in to Firefox to allow people (even non programmers) to record tests, and reuse them independantly or as part of a set of tests for RC </p>
	<p>(TODO)</p>
