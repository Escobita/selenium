Remote Control</h2>
<p>The
Remote Control mode is more advanced. It is able to test a wider range
of web-applications than Selenium-Core and is more scalable, but

<h2><a name="Selenium_Grid"></a>Selenium Grid</h2>
<p>This additional server piece allows the several
Remote Control servers to accessed in parallel by one or more driving
processes. &nbsp;You may want to do this if you want to use scale
to
speed everything up, or because you need to test on Mac and/or Linux,
as well as Windows from one driving test-suite.</p>
