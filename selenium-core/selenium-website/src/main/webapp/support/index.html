<h1>Getting Help</h1>

<p>If you find any problems using Selenium, there are several places where you can
search for help and where volunteers like you and me will spend their time
trying to help you save yours.</p>


<h2>User Forums</h2>

<p>The first place where people ask for help about Selenium is the <a href="http://clearspace.openqa.org/community/selenium">Official
Forums</a>. Here, you''ll find that most of the time, someone already found the
problem you are facing right now, and usually reached the solution for
which you are looking.</p>

<p>Of course, if you can't find any previous solution to your problem, you can
always create an account in the forums and start your own thread asking for
help.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Note: Please make sure to look in the forums before asking for something.
It's very frustrating for the people that are reading and helping others to
find that you didn't even make the effort of searching for the solution on
your own.</p>
</div>

<h2>Chat Room</h2>

<p>The best place to ask for help is the forums (because they also keep the
information accessible for others to read in the future). However, if you have a very
important (or too simple) issue that needs a solution ASAP, you can always enter
the IRC chat room. You might just find someone ready to help on <em>#selenium at
Freenode</em> (irc.freenode.net).</p>

<h2><a name="BugTracker">Bug Tracker</a></h2>
<p>
    Selenium's <a href="http://jira.openqa.org">Bug Tracker</a> can be used to log new bugs, check the status of an existing one or as inspiration to help make Selenium better.
