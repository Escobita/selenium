<h2>Help from the forums</h2>

<p>
    Selenium has a very active community that posts hundreds of new messages every day. The community is very diverse, ranging from entry-level testers to experienced QA engineers to hard core open source developers.
</p>

<p>
    Before posting, please be sure to read the rules of the forums. Remember that everyone who works on Selenium is a volunteer, so please be respectful of their time and effort.

<p>
    Selenium's forums are graciously hosted by OpenQA and available at:
