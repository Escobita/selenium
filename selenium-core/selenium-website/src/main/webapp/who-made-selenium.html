<h1 class="first">Who made Selenium</h1>
The story starts at
ThoughtWorks with Jason Huggins (now at Google) build the Core mode as
"JavaScriptTestRunner" for the testing of an internal Time and Expenses
application (Pyhton, Plone). He has help from Paul Gross and Jie Tina
Wang. For them this was a day job.<br>
<br>
Jason
started demoing the test tool to various colleagues. Many were
excited about its immediate and intuitive visual feedback, as well as
its potential to grow as a reusable testing framework for other web
applications.<br>
<br>
Paul Hammant saw the demo,
and started discussions about the open sourcing of Selenium, as well as
defining a 'driven' mode of Selenium where you'd get to use Selenium
over the wire from a language of your choice, that would get around the
'same origin policy'. &nbsp;Aslak Hellesoy (then
ThoughtWorks)&nbsp;
experimented with different ideas for the 'server' piece, including
page rewriting to get around the same origin policy. &nbsp;Paul
wrote
the original server piece in Java, and Aslak and Obie Fernandez (then
ThoughtWorks) ported that the client driver to Ruby.<br>
<br>
ThoughtWorkers
in various offices around the world picked up Selenium for commercial
projects, and
contributed back to Selenium from the lessons learned on these
projects. &nbsp;Mike Williams, Darrell Deboer,
and Darren Cotterill all helped with the increasing the capabilities
and
the robustness of it.<br>

<br>
At Bea, Dan Fabulich (now at Redfin) and
Nelson Sproul came to the conclusion that the driver/server to browser
architecture was not the most useful or flexible, so forked the driver
coder and crafted that into a standalone server that leveraged and
bundled MortBay's Jetty as a web-proxy. &nbsp;When the code was
merged
back it became known as "Selenium Remote Control" and the old driven
codeline and capability was retired.<br>
<br>
Pat Lightbody became
involved at the same time, with a commercial idea that required him to
quit his day job (Jive Software). &nbsp;The idea was "Hosted QA",
and
it was eventually moved into Gomez's service line (with Pat).
&nbsp;Pat
worked with Dan and Nelson making Selenium RC stable for large scale
deployment. &nbsp;Pat had privately coded a Grid for Hosted QA that
took screenshots of browsers in various states, and was looking after
multiple customers concurrently. &nbsp;Jason had the same hosted QA
idea a year before, but did not quit his day job to do it!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IDE Made in Japan ...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Shinya
Kasatani in Japan became interested in Selenium, and realised that he
could wrap the core code into an IDE module into the Firefox browser,
and be able to record tests as well as play them back in the same
plugin. &nbsp;This tool, turned out an eye opener in more ways that
was
originally thought as it is not bound to the same origin policy.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><br>
Mike Williams got involved again in the Summer of 2006 where
he led a team from ThoughWorks China, primarily WangPengChao,
HuangLiang and XiongJie but with the help of others. They worked on
improving Selenium Core with the goal of getting it closer to 1.0<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Google too ? ...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Jennifer Bevan (and other
unnamed Googlers) coded their own Grid capabilty for Selenium RC, and
deployed it internally for the testing of multiple public web
applications. &nbsp;As with much of what Google did, this was a
secret
for a couple of years, until Google hosted a GTAC conference in New
York and talked about it. &nbsp;Jennifer soon became a committer on
the
Selenium projects.<br>
<br>
Haw-bin Chai in Chicago provided patches for
Xpath functionality and developed an extension called "UI Element" that
makes the grammar of locators much simpler. &nbsp;He was invited
into
the Selenium development team in 2007.<br>
<br>
Simon Stewart at
ThoughtWorks had been working on a different web teting tool called
WebDriver. &nbsp;It did not rely on JavaScript to do the heavy
lifting,
but instead had a client for each browser that was coded from scratch.
It also had a 'higher level' API than Selenium-RC and showed lots of
promise. &nbsp;Simon presented the tool at GTAC, and started work
on
compatibility with Selenium-RC, which gave rise to the obvious
conclusion that the two projects should merge. &nbsp;Simon, now at
Google, gets to spend some of his time making that a reality.<br>
