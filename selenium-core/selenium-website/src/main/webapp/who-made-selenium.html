<h1 class="first">Who made Selenium</h1>
<p>The story starts in 2004 at
  <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> in Chicago, with <a href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/">Jason Huggins</a> building the Core mode as
  "JavaScriptTestRunner" for the testing of an internal Time and Expenses
  application (Pyhton, Plone). He has help from Paul Gross and Jie Tina
  Wang. For them, this was a day job.<br>
  <br>
  Jason
  started demoing the test tool to various colleagues. Many were
  excited about its immediate and intuitive visual feedback, as well as
  its potential to grow as a reusable testing framework for other web
  applications.<br>
  <br>
  Soon after in 2004 fellow ThoughtWorker Paul Hammant saw the demo,
  and started discussions about the open sourcing of Selenium, as well as
  defining a 'driven' mode of Selenium where you'd get to use Selenium
  over the wire from a language of your choice, that would get around the
  'same origin policy'. &nbsp; Another (then) colleague, <a href="http://blog.aslakhellesoy.com/">Aslak Hellesoy</a>, experimented with different ideas for the 'server' piece, including
  page rewriting to get around the same origin policy. &nbsp;Paul
  wrote
  the original server piece in Java, and Aslak and <a href="http://obiefernandez.com/">Obie Fernandez</a> ported that the client driver to Ruby, setting the foundation for drivers in yet more languages.<br>
  <br>
  ThoughtWorkers
  in various offices around the world picked up Selenium for commercial
  projects, and
  contributed back to Selenium from the lessons learned on these
  projects. &nbsp;Mike Williams, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/896/b41">Darrell Deboer</a>,
  and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/465/293">Darren Cotterill</a> all helped with the increasing the capabilities
  and
  the robustness of it.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Friends of ThoughtWorks

  <br>
  At <a href="http://www.bea.com">Bea</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/3B2/569">Dan Fabulich</a> and
  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/250/72B">Nelson Sproul</a> came to the conclusion that the driver/server to browser
  architecture was not the most useful or flexible, so forked the driver
  coder and crafted that into a standalone server that leveraged and
  bundled MortBay's Jetty as a web-proxy. &nbsp;When the code was
  merged
  back it became known as "Selenium Remote Control" and the old driven
  codeline and capability was retired.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://lightbody.net/blog/">Pat Lightbody</a> became
  involved at the same time, with a commercial idea that required him to
  quit his day job (Jive Software). &nbsp;The idea was "Hosted QA",
  and
  it was eventually moved into <a href="http://www.gomez.com/">Gomez's</a> service line.
  &nbsp;Pat
  worked with Dan and Nelson making Selenium RC stable for large scale
  deployment. &nbsp;Pat had privately coded a grid for Hosted QA that
  took screenshots of browsers in various states, and was looking after
  multiple customers concurrently. &nbsp;Jason had the same hosted QA
idea a year before, but did not quit his day job to do it.</p>
<p>In 2007 Dan moved to the rapidly growing <a href="http://www.redfin.com">Redfin</a>, who also part-time sponsor his time on Selenium, and encourage a speaking agenda.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Selenium-IDE Made in Japan ...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/4/488/702">Shinya Kasatani</a> in Japan became interested in Selenium, and realised that he
  could wrap the core code into an IDE module into the Firefox browser,
  and be able to record tests as well as play them back in the same
  plugin. &nbsp;This tool, turned out an eye opener in more ways that
  was
  originally thought as it is not bound to the same origin policy.<br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><br>
  Mike Williams got involved again in the Summer of 2006 where
  he led a team from ThoughWorks China, primarily WangPengChao,
  HuangLiang and XiongJie but with the help of others. They worked on
  improving Selenium Core with the goal of getting it closer to 1.0<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Google too ? ...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <br>
  Jennifer Bevan (and other
  unnamed Googlers) coded their own grid capabilty for Selenium RC, and
  deployed it internally for the testing of multiple public web
  applications. &nbsp;As with much of what Google did, this was a
  secret
  for a couple of years, until Google hosted a GTAC conference in New
  York and talked about it. &nbsp;Jennifer soon became a committer on
  the
  Selenium projects. Jason Huggins left Thoughtworks in 2007 and joined the Selenium support team inside Google.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Haw-Bin_Chai/4102476">Haw-bin Chai</a> in Chicago provided patches for
  Xpath functionality and developed an extension called "UI Element" that
  makes the grammar of locators much simpler. &nbsp;He was invited
  into
  the Selenium development team in 2007.<br>
  <br>
  Simon Stewart at
  ThoughtWorks had been working on a different web teting tool called
  WebDriver. &nbsp;It did not rely on JavaScript to do the heavy
  lifting,
  but instead had a client for each browser that was coded from scratch.
  It also had a 'higher level' API than Selenium-RC and showed lots of
  promise. &nbsp;Simon presented the tool at GTAC, and started work
  on
  compatibility with Selenium-RC, which gave rise to the obvious
  conclusion that the two projects should merge. &nbsp;Simon, now at
Google, gets to spend some of his time making that a reality.</p>
