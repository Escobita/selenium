<h1 class="first">Who made Selenium</h1>The story starts at
ThoughtWorks with Jason Huggins (now at Google) build the Core mode as
"JavaScriptTestRunner" for the testing of an internal Time and Expenses
application (Pyhton, Plone). He has help from Paul Gross and Jie Tina
Wang. For them this was a day job.<br><br>Paul Hammant saw the demo,
and started discussions to the open sourcing of Selenium, as well as
defining a 'driven' mode of Selenium where you'd get to use Selenium
over the wire from a language of your choice, that would get around the
'same origin policy'. &nbsp;Aslak Hellesoy (then ThoughtWorks)&nbsp;
experimented with different ideas for the 'server' piece, including
page rewriting to get around the same origin policy. &nbsp;Paul wrote
the original server piece in Java, and Aslak and Obie Fernandez (then
ThoughtWorks) ported that the client driver to Ruby.<br><br>ThoughtWorkers
in various offices picked up Selenium for commercial projects, and
contributed back to the project. &nbsp;Mike Williams, Darrel Deboer,
and Darren Cotteril all helped with the increasing the capabilities and
the robustness of it.<br><br>At Bea, Dan Fabulich (now at Redfin) and
Nelson Sproul came to the conclusion that the driver/server to browser
architecture was not the most useful or flexible, so forked the driver
coder and crafted that into a standalone server that leveraged and
bundled MortBay's Jetty as a web-proxy. &nbsp;When the code was merged
back it became known as "Selenium Remote Control" and the old driven
codeline and capability was retired.<br><br>Pat Lightbody became
involved at the same time, with a commercial idea that required him to
quit his day job (Jive Software). &nbsp;The idea was "Hosted QA", and
it was eventually moved into Gomez's service line (with Pat). &nbsp;Pat
worked with Dan and Nelson making Selenium RC stable for large scale
deployment. &nbsp;Pat had privately coded a Grid for Hosted QA that
took screenshots of browsers in various states, and was looking after
multiple customers concurrently. &nbsp;Jason had the same hosted QA
idea a year before, but did not quit his day job to do it!<br><br>Shinya
Kasatani in Japan became interested in Selenium, and realised that he
could wrap the core code into an IDE module into the Firefox browser,
and be able to record tests as well as play them back in the same
plugin. &nbsp;This tool, turned out an eye opener in more ways that was
originally thought as it is not bound to the same origin policy.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>
<br>Mike Williams and ... got involved again for ThoughtWorks when he
lead a ThoughtWorks team in China improving the Javascript core of
selenium in the summer of 2006.<br><br>Jennifer Bevan (and other
unnamed Googlers) coded their own Grid capabilty for Selenium RC, and
deployed it internally for the testing of multiple public web
applications. &nbsp;As with much of what Google did, this was a secret
for a couple of years, until Google hosted a GTAC conference in New
York and talked about it. &nbsp;Jennifer soon became a committer on the
Selenium projects.<br><br>Haw-bin Chai in Chicago provided patches for
Xpath functionality and developed an extension called "UI Element" that
makes the grammar of locators much simpler. &nbsp;He was invited into
the Selenium development team in 2007.<br><br>Simon Stewart at
ThoughtWorks had been working on a different web teting tool called
WebDriver. &nbsp;It did not rely on JavaScript to do the heavy lifting,
but instead had a client for each browser that was coded from scratch.
It also had a 'higher level' API than Selenium-RC and showed lots of
promise. &nbsp;Simon presented the tool at GTAC, and started work on
compatibility with Selenium-RC, which gave rise to the obvious
conclusion that the two projects should merge. &nbsp;Simon, now at
Google, gets to spend some of his time making that a reality.<br><h2>Fallen by the wayside,&nbsp;never started, or not started yet.</h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gone</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Paul's driven code and names "Selenium A and B" for core and driven. &nbsp;Driven as a name too, for RC<br>Aslak's page rewriter to get around the same origin policy<br>Jason's twisted capabilty for giving Selenium core more client/server capabiity<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Never started</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Paul's Squid-proxy plugin (C++), RC server negates the need for it<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not started yet</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>IE Plugin, listening on a socket<br>&nbsp;<br><br><br>
