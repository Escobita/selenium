    <!-- 
    To derive this prop I was initially working with the TEMP variable, which I think is standard
    on Windows boxes, but this variable contains a number of funny characters from 
    being compressed to 8.3 mode, and this seems to confuse IIS.  If I keep the 
    temporary directory name simple, then everything works:
    --> 
    <property name="tmp" value="c:/selenium_temp_dotnet"/>
    
    <target name="all">
        <copy todir="${tmp}">
            <fileset dir="."/>
        </copy>
        <!--  output="${tmp}/nant_out.txt" -->
        <exec dir="${tmp}" executable="tools/nant/NAnt.exe" failonerror="true">
            <arg line="-buildfile:selenium.build -nologo"/>
        </exec>
    </target>
</project>
