Developers meet and discuss project details at the <a href="http://clearspace.openqa.org/community/selenium_remote_control/selenium_remote_control_developers">Selenium Remote Control Developer Forums</a>. Anyone is invited to participate in these forums with development-related questions, ideas, and comments. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Patches</li>
<li>Feature requests</li>
<li>Non user-facing questions (development related)</li>
<li>Suggestions</li>
<li>Offers for help</li>
</ul>
<p>If your message to the team isn't development-related, but you still want the development team to see it, don't worry: the User Forums is also monitored by the entire development team. And if you are unsure of where to post your message, use the User Forums as it will offer the widest audience to provide feedback and help.
