<p>
Any Selenium Remote Control-related question can be submitted at the Selenium Remote Control User Forums. Anyone is invited to participate in these forums with user-related questions and comments. These include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bug reports</li>
  <li>"How to" questions</li>
  <li>Best practices</li>
  <li>Other questions not answered in the documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>
We highly encourage you to consult the documentation before posting any questions -- often your questions can be answered there. We also suggest searching the forums archives, as someone else has probably come across the same issue you are having.
