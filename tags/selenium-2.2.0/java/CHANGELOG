v2.1.0
======

WebDriver:
  * Round to 0 if something looks like it's off the edge of the screen when
    calculating distances. Fixes issue 1776.
  * Deleting the deprecated TimeoutException inner class and replacing with the
    top-level one

Grid:
  * Properly form the HTML output for console display.
  * Track when a session has become orphaned.  I.e., when the client sends no
    commands after the initial session creation.  This almost always indicates
    the client is no longer connected and the session is unusable immediately.
