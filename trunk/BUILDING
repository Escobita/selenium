Selenium 2.0 builds with its own build technology that's good for Windows, Linux and Mac.

In the same directory as this file, do ...

   ./go

The order of building modules is determined by the 'go' system itself.  If you want to 
build an individual module (assuming all dependent modules have previously been build)
try something like ...

   ./go //jsapi:atoms:run

In this case, jsapi is the module directory, and "atoms" is a target in that directory's 
build.desc file

More general help for 'go' ...

   ./go --help

Ignore the Maven POM file present in the same directory. It is only used for releasing 
to jars to Maven Repository (public or local), and is not considered the main build
mechanism.
