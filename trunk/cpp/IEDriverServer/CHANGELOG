Version number notation guide: 
The version number of the IEDriverServer.exe is in the pattern as follows:

  major.minor.build.revision

The "major" and "minor" fields are synchronized to releases of the Selenium
project. Changes in the "build" field indicate interim releases made publicly
available via the project downloads page. Changes in "revision" field indicate
private releases checked into the prebuilts directory of the source tree, but
not made generally available on the downloads page.

v2.25.2.2
=========
 * Increased logging when getting registry values.
 * Fixed spacing in log messages 

v2.25.2.1
=========
 * Updated to return ENOSUCHWINDOW if trying to switch to a window ID that does
   not exist.

v2.25.2.0
=========
 * Fixed IE6 case for checking browser zoom level.
 * Now repeatedly sending WM_MOUSEMOVE messages on a separate thread to try to
   quell mouse hover issues.

v2.25.1.0
=========
 * Added error checking for zoom level for IE. The IE driver will now throw an
   exception if the zoom level isn't 100%. This behavior can be disabled in the
   IE driver by setting the "ignoreZoomLevel" capability. Fixes Issue #4272.
 * Stop execution when a call to IWebBrowser2::Navigate2() fails in the IE
   driver. This prevents a hang when we weren't checking for an error
   condition. Fixes issue #4279.

v2.25.0.0
=========
 * Handle quirky handling of mime types if Firefox was ever the default browser
   on a Windows installation, but now a different (non-IE) browser has stepped
   into that role.
 * Increased timeout for finding file upload dialog in uploading file. Fixes
   issue #3858.
 * Updated initialization of variables in MouseMoveToCommandHandler.h and in
   GetElementLocationOnceScrolledIntoViewCommandHandler.h. Fixes issue #4205.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.24.2.0
=========
 * Refactoring command line argument handling in IEDriverServer.exe, now that
   the number of valid arguments is growing.
 * Added ability to control log level and log file via command line switches to
   IEDriverServer.exe (on behalf of AlexandrSavchuk).
 * Re-added else-if for GetSessionList command inadvertently removed in r15345.
   Fixes issue #4160.
 * Added logging message to a large portion of the IE driver (on behalf of 
   AlexandrSavchuk). Set the log file with

       --log-file="C:\full\path\to\filename.log"

   (default is to log to the console). Set the logging level with

       --log-level=LOGLEVEL

   where LOGLEVEL is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL (default
   is FATAL). Fixes issue #4159

v2.24.1.0
=========
 * Added elementScrollBehavior capability to allow users to specify how
   elements scroll into the viewport for interaction. Default behavior is
   unchanged (the capability is set to 0), but can be set to scroll to align
   to the bottom of the viewport by setting the capability to 1.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.24.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.23.2.0
=========
 * Crash prevention for when there is no "current" browser window, like when
   the current window is closed without the user switching to another window.
   Fixes issue #4071.

v2.23.1.1
=========
 * Crash prevention for when IWebBrowser2::get_Document() returns S_FALSE.

 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.22.1.0
=========
 * Re-enabling native code driver to understand "nativeEvents" capability.
