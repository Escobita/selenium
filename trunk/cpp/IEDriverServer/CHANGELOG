Version number notation guide: 
The version number of the IEDriverServer.exe is in the pattern as follows:

  major.minor.build.revision

The "major" and "minor" fields are synchronized to releases of the Selenium
project. Changes in the "build" field indicate interim releases made publicly
available via the project downloads page. Changes in "revision" field indicate
private releases checked into the prebuilts directory of the source tree, but
not made generally available on the downloads page.
