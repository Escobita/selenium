Version number notation guide: 
The version number of the IEDriverServer.exe is in the pattern as follows:

  major.minor.build.revision

The "major" and "minor" fields are synchronized to releases of the Selenium
project. Changes in the "build" field indicate interim releases made publicly
available via the project downloads page. Changes in "revision" field indicate
private releases checked into the prebuilts directory of the source tree, but
not made generally available on the downloads page.

v2.25.0.0
=========
 * Handle quirky handling of mime types if Firefox was ever the default browser
   on a Windows installation, but now a different (non-IE) browser has stepped
   into that role.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.24.2.0
=========
 * Refactoring command line argument handling in IEDriverServer.exe, now that
   the number of valid arguments is growing.
 * Added ability to control log level and log file via command line switches to
   IEDriverServer.exe (on behalf of AlexandrSavchuk).
 * Re-added else-if for GetSessionList command inadvertently removed in r15345.
   Fixes issue #4160.
 * Added logging message to a large portion of the IE driver (on behalf of 
   AlexandrSavchuk). Set the log file with

       --log-file="C:\full\path\to\filename.log"

   (default is to log to the console). Set the logging level with

       --log-level=LOGLEVEL

   where LOGLEVEL is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL (default
   is FATAL). Fixes issue #4159

v2.24.1.0
=========
 * Added elementScrollBehavior capability to allow users to specify how
   elements scroll into the viewport for interaction. Default behavior is
   unchanged (the capability is set to 0), but can be set to scroll to align
   to the bottom of the viewport by setting the capability to 1.
