   *    'forceAllowThirdPartyCookie' property set, then:
   *    a) If 'aURI' is null, return false.

   * 3) Obtain the bottommost nsIDOMWindow, and its same-type parent if it
   *    exists, from the channel's notification callbacks. Then:
   *    a) If the parent is the same as the bottommost window, and the channel
   *       has the LOAD_DOCUMENT_URI flag set, return false. This represents the

   *       of the channel's bottommost window and the channel URI, respectively.
