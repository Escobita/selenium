// A DnsMaster object is instantiated once in the browser
// process, and manages asynchronous resolution of DNS hostnames.
// Most hostname lists are sent out by renderer processes, and
// involve lists of hostnames that *might* be used in the near
// future by the browsing user.  The goal of this class is to
// cause the underlying DNS structure to lookup a hostname before
// it is really needed, and hence reduce latency in the standard
// lookup paths.
