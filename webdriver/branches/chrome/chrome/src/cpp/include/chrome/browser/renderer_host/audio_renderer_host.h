// AudioRendererHost serves audio related requests from AudioRenderer which
// lives inside the render process and provide access to audio hardware. It maps
// an internal ID to AudioRendererHost::IPCAudioSource in a map, which is the
// actual object providing audio packets through IPC. It creates the actual
// AudioOutputStream object when requested by the renderer provided with
// render view id and stream id.
//
// AudioRendererHost::IPCAudioSource is a container of AudioOutputStream and
// provide audio packets to the associated AudioOutputStream through IPC. It
// transforms the pull data model to a push model used for IPC. When asked by
// AudioOutputStream for an audio packet, it would send a message to renderer,
// passing a SharedMemoryHandle for filling the buffer.
// NotifyPacketReady(|render_view_id|, |stream_id|) would be called when the
// buffer is filled and ready to be consumed.
//
// This class is owned by BrowserRenderProcessHost, and instantiated on UI
// thread, but all other operations and method calls (except Destroy()) happens
// in IO thread, so we need to be extra careful about the lifetime of this
// object. AudioManager is a singleton and created in IO thread, audio output
// streams are also created in the IO thread, so we need to destroy them also
// in IO thread. After this class is created, a task of OnInitialized() is
// posted on IO thread in which singleton of AudioManager is created and
// AddRef() is called to increase one ref count of this object. Owner of this
// class should call Destroy() before decrementing the ref count to this object,
// which essentially post a task of OnDestroyed() on IO thread. Inside
// OnDestroyed(), audio output streams are destroyed and Release() is called
// which may result in self-destruction.
//
// TODO(hclam): Have these things done:
//   1. Make AudioManager a singleton and construct/destruct it properly.
