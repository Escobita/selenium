// This class is a simple storage place for storing/retrieving views.  It is
// used for example in the FocusManager to store/restore focused views when the
// main window becomes active/inactive.  It supports floating views, meaning
// that when you store a view, it can be retrieved even if it is a floating
// view or the child of a floating view that has been detached since the view
// was stored (in which case the floating view is recreated and reattached).
// It also automatically removes a view from the storage if the view is removed
// from the tree hierarchy (or in the case of a floating view, if the view
// containing the floating view is removed).
//
// To use it, you first need to create a view storage id that can then be used
// to store/retrieve views.
