// FilterHost describes an interface for individual filters to access and
// modify global playback information.  Every filter is given a filter host
// reference as part of initialization.
//
// This interface is intentionally verbose to cover the needs for the different
// types of filters (see media/base/filters.h for filter definitionss).  Filters
// typically use parts of the interface that are relevant to their function.
// For example, an audio renderer filter typically calls SetTime as it feeds
// data to the audio hardware.  A video renderer filter typically calls GetTime
// to synchronize video with audio.  An audio and video decoder would typically
// have no need to call either SetTime or GetTime.
//
// The reasoning behind providing PostTask is to discourage filters from
// implementing their own threading.  The overall design is that many filters
// can share few threads and that notifications return quickly by scheduling
// processing with PostTask.
