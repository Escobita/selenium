// Filter performs filtering on data streams. Sample usage:
//
//   IStream* pre_filter_source;
//   ...
//   Filter* filter = Filter::Factory(filter_type, size);
//   int pre_filter_data_len = filter->stream_buffer_size();
//   pre_filter_source->read(filter->stream_buffer(), pre_filter_data_len);
//
//   filter->FlushStreamBuffer(pre_filter_data_len);
//
//   char post_filter_buf[kBufferSize];
//   int post_filter_data_len = kBufferSize;
//   filter->ReadFilteredData(post_filter_buf, &post_filter_data_len);
//
// To filter a data stream, the caller first gets filter's stream_buffer_
// through its accessor and fills in stream_buffer_ with pre-filter data, next
// calls FlushStreamBuffer to notify Filter, then calls ReadFilteredData
// repeatedly to get all the filtered data. After all data have been fitlered
// and read out, the caller may fill in stream_buffer_ again. This
// WriteBuffer-Flush-Read cycle is repeated until reaching the end of data
// stream.
//
// The lifetime of a Filter instance is completely controlled by its caller.
