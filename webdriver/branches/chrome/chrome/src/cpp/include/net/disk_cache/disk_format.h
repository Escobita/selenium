// The cache is stored on disk as a collection of block-files, plus an index
// file plus a collection of external files.
//
// Any data blob bigger than kMaxBlockSize (net/addr.h) will be stored on a
// separate file named f_xxx where x is a hexadecimal number. Shorter data will
// be stored as a series of blocks on a block-file. In any case, CacheAddr
// represents the address of the data inside the cache.
//
// The index file is just a simple hash table that maps a particular entry to
// a CacheAddr value. Linking for a given hash bucket is handled internally
// by the cache entry.
//
// The last element of the cache is the block-file. A block file is a file
// designed to store blocks of data of a given size. It is able to store data
// that spans from one to four consecutive "blocks", and it grows as needed to
// store up to approximately 65000 blocks. It has a fixed size header used for
// book keeping such as tracking free of blocks on the file. For example, a
// block-file for 1KB blocks will grow from 8KB when totally empty to about 64MB
// when completely full. At that point, data blocks of 1KB will be stored on a
// second block file that will store the next set of 65000 blocks. The first
// file contains the number of the second file, and the second file contains the
// number of a third file, created when the second file reaches its limit. It is
// important to remember that no matter how long the chain of files is, any
// given block can be located directly by its address, which contains the file
// number and starting block inside the file.
//
// A new cache is initialized with four block files (named data_0 through
// data_3), each one dedicated to store blocks of a given size. The number at
// the end of the file name is the block file number (in decimal).
//
// There are two "special" types of blocks: an entry and a rankings node. An
// entry keeps track of all the information related to the same cache entry,
// such as the key, hash value, data pointers etc. A rankings node keeps track
// of the information that is updated frequently for a given entry, such as its
// location on the LRU lists, last access time etc.
//
// The files that store internal information for the cache (blocks and index)
// are at least partially memory mapped. They have a location that is signaled
// every time the internal structures are modified, so it is possible to detect
// (most of the time) when the process dies in the middle of an update.
//
// In order to prevent dirty data to be used as valid (after a crash), every
// cache entry has a dirty identifier. Each running instance of the cache keeps
// a separate identifier (maintained on the "this_id" header field) that is used
// to mark every entry that is created or modified. When the entry is closed,
// and all the data can be trusted, the dirty flag is cleared from the entry.
// When the cache encounters an entry whose identifier is different than the one
// being currently used, it means that the entry was not properly closed on a
// previous run, so it is discarded.
