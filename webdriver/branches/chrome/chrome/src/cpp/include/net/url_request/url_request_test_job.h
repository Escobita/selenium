// This job type is designed to help with simple unit tests. To use, you
// probably want to inherit from it to set up the state you want. Then install
// it as the protocol handler for the "test" scheme.
//
// It will respond to three URLs, which you can retrieve using the test_url*
// getters, which will in turn respond with the corresponding responses returned
// by test_data*. Any other URLs that begin with "test:" will return an error,
// which might also be useful, you can use test_url_error() to retreive a
// standard one.
//
// You can override the known URLs or the response data by overriding Start().
//
// When a job is created, it gets put on a queue of pending test jobs. To
// process jobs on this queue, use ProcessOnePendingMessage, which will process
// one step of the next job. If the job is incomplete, it will be added to the
// end of the queue.
