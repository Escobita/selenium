// A device is basically a wrapper around SkBitmap that provides a surface for
// SkCanvas to draw into. Our device provides a surface CoreGraphics can also
// write to. BitmapPlatformDeviceMac creates a bitmap using
// CGCreateBitmapContext() in a format that Skia supports and can then use this
// to draw text into, etc. This pixel data is provided to the bitmap that the
// device contains so that it can be shared.
//
// The device owns the pixel data, when the device goes away, the pixel data
// also becomes invalid. THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN NORMAL SKIA which uses
// reference counting for the pixel data. In normal Skia, you could assign
// another bitmap to this device's bitmap and everything will work properly.
// For us, that other bitmap will become invalid as soon as the device becomes
// invalid, which may lead to subtle bugs. Therefore, DO NOT ASSIGN THE
// DEVICE'S PIXEL DATA TO ANOTHER BITMAP, make sure you copy instead.
