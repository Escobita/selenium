#summary Information about the Firefox Driver

= Firefox Driver =

Everything you ever wanted to know about the Firefox driver but were afraid to ask.

== Installing ==

There is a plan to make the FirefoxDriver installable as a simple XPI. Until then, you'll need to install the extension by hand. This isn't as terrifying as you might think:

 # Find out where your profile directory ($PROFILE_DIR) is. The best guide for that is here: http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/profile
 # Create a new "WebDriver" profile. The camel case matters!
   * This is done using {{{firefox -ProfileManager}}}
   * Or by following the instructions from the page mentioned above
 # Create a file called {{{fxdriver@thoughtworks.com}}} in {{{$PROFILE_DIR/xxxxxxxx.WebDriver/extensions/}}} The contents of this file should be a single line, containing the absolute path to the FirefoxDriver's extension directory ({{{firefox/src/extension}}})

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript
 * Not as fast as the HtmlUnitDriver, but faster than the InternetExplorerDriver

== Cons ==
 
 * Not complete
