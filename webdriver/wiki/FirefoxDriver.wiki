#summary Information about the Firefox Driver

= Firefox Driver =

Everything you ever wanted to know about the Firefox driver but were afraid to ask.

== Installing the Quick Way ==

There is a plan to make the FirefoxDriver installable as a simple XPI. Until then, you'll need Ruby and rake installed on your machine, then (after quitting any open instances of Firefox) simply run:

{{{rake install_firefox}}}

This assumes that your installation of Firefox 2 is pretty standard. On Windows, this means that it should be installed in the default location ("C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox") and on the Mac under "/Applications/Firefox". On Linux, it is assumed that firefox is available on the default PATH. If your firefox is installed in a custom location, then set the "firefox" variable to be the firefox binary to use:

{{{rake install_firefox firefox="d:\apps\mozilla firefox\firefox"}}}

After the installation is completed, Firefox should start using the new WebDriver profile. Go to "{{{Tools->Add-ons}}}" and check that there's an extension called "Firefox WebDriver" installed. Carry on reading below if it's not!

== Installing the Long Way ==

If the quick way doesn't work for you, or you'd like to understand more about what to do, you'll need to install the extension by hand. This isn't as terrifying as you might think:

 # Find out where your profile directory ($PROFILE_DIR) is. The best guide for that is here: http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/profile
 # Create a new "WebDriver" profile. The camel case matters!
   * This is done using {{{firefox -ProfileManager}}}
   * Or by following the instructions from the page mentioned above
 # Create a file called {{{fxdriver@thoughtworks.com}}} in {{{$PROFILE_DIR/xxxxxxxx.WebDriver/extensions/}}} The contents of this file should be a single line, containing the absolute path to the FirefoxDriver's extension directory ({{{firefox/src/extension}}})

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript
 * Not as fast as the HtmlUnitDriver, but faster than the InternetExplorerDriver

== Cons ==
 
 * Not complete
