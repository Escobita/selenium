#summary Information about the Firefox Driver

= Firefox Driver =

Everything you ever wanted to know about the Firefox driver but were afraid to ask. See below for instructions on how to install the FirefoxDriver.

== Before Going Any Further ==

The FirefoxDriver contains everything it needs in the JAR file. If you're just interested in using this driver, then all you need to do is put the {{{webdriver-firefox.jar}}} on your CLASSPATH, and WebDriver will do everything else for you.

If you want to dig deeper, though, carry on reading!

== Important System Properties ==

The following system properties (read using {{{System.getProperty()}}}) are used by the FirefoxDriver:

|| *Property* || *What it means* ||
|| webdriver.firefox.bin || The location of the binary used to control firefox. ||
|| webdriver.firefox.development || When using the {{{FirefoxLauncher}}} class to create the profile, this indicates that you are using the development version of WebDriver (that is, one that is checked out from source) ||
|| webdriver.firefox.profile || The name of the profile to use when starting firefox. This defaults to *WebDriver* ||
|| webdriver.firefox.useExisting || Use a running instance of firefox if one is present ||

Normally the Firefox binary is assumed to be in the default location for your particular operating system:

|| *OS* || *Expected Location of Firefox* ||
|| Linux || firefox (found using "which") ||
|| Mac || /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox ||
|| Windows || %PROGRAMFILES%\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe ||

The default profile name is *WebDriver* (the casing matters!)

== Installing a Downloaded Binary ==

The "wedriver-firefox.zip" which may be downloaded from the website, contains all the dependencies (including the common library) required to run the FirefoxDriver. In order to use it:

 # Copy all the "jar" files on to your classpath.

== Installing the Quick Way From Source (with Ruby) ==

If you're doing development work, you may will need to install the FirefoxDriver into a profile called {{{WebDriver}}} (the case matters!) If you have the source, you can set everything up correctly by running:

{{{rake install_firefox}}}

This assumes that your installation of Firefox 2 or 3 is pretty standard. On Windows, this means that it should be installed in the default location ("C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox") and on the Mac under "/Applications/Firefox". On Linux, it is assumed that firefox is available on the default PATH. If your firefox is installed in a custom location, then set the "firefox" variable to be the firefox binary to use:

{{{rake install_firefox firefox="d:\apps\mozilla firefox\firefox"}}}

After the installation is completed, Firefox should start using the new WebDriver profile. Go to "{{{Tools->Add-ons}}}" and check that there's an extension called "Firefox WebDriver" installed. Carry on reading below if it's not!

== Installing the Long Way ==

If the quick way doesn't work for you, or you'd like to understand more about what to do, you'll need to install the extension by hand. This isn't as terrifying as you might think:

 # Find out where your profile directory ($PROFILE_DIR) is. The best guide for that is here: http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/profile
 # Create a new "WebDriver" profile. The camel case matters!
   * This is done using {{{firefox -ProfileManager}}}
   * Or by following the instructions from the page mentioned above
 # Create a file called {{{fxdriver@googlecode.com}}} in {{{$PROFILE_DIR/xxxxxxxx.WebDriver/extensions/}}} The contents of this file should be a single line, containing the absolute path to the FirefoxDriver's extension directory ({{{firefox/src/extension}}})

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript
 * Faster than the InternetExplorerDriver

== Cons ==
 
 * Slower than the HtmlUnitDriver
