*Q: What is WebDriver?*

A: WebDriver is a tool for writing automated tests of websites. It aims to mimic the behaviour of a real user, and as such interacts with the HTML of the application.

*Q: So, is it like [http://www.openqa.org/selenium-core/ Selenium]? Or [http://sahi.co.in/ Sahi]?*

A: The aim is the same (to allow you to test your webapp), but the implementation is different. Rather than running as a Javascript application within the browser (with the limitations this brings, such as the "[http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/tutorial.html same origin]" problem), WebDriver controls the browser itself. This means that it can take advantage of any facilities offered by the native platform.

*Q: What is Selenium 2.0?*

A: WebDriver will soon become part of [http://www.openqa.org/selenium Selenium]. The main contribution that WebDriver will make is its API and the native drivers. The process of rolling WebDriver into Selenium will probably take some time, so until it's complete if you'd like to use the WebDriver API then the best bet will be to use WebDriver directly.

*Q: What does it mean to be "developer focused"?

A: We believe that within a software application's development team, the people who are best placed to build the tools that everyone else can use are the developers. Although it should be easy to use WebDriver directly, it should also be easy to use it as a building block for more sophisticated tools. Because of this, WebDriver has a small API that's easy to explore by hitting the "autocomplete" button in your favourite IDE, and aims to work consistently no matter which browser implementation you use.

*Q: Why can't I execute Javascript directly? Other web testing tools allow this*

A: We believe that most of the time there is a requirement to execute Javascript there is a failing in the tool being used: it hasn't emitted the correct events, has not interacted with a page correctly, or has failed to react when an XmlHttpRequest returns. We would rather fix WebDriver to work consistently and correctly than rely on testers working out which Javascript method to call.

We also realise that there will be times when this is a limitation, and if you find this is a case please ask for help on the [http://groups.google.com/group/webdriver mailing list]. We'll do our best to help develop a simple, workable solution.

*Q: Which browsers does WebDriver support?*

A: The existing drivers are the InternetExplorerDriver, FirefoxDriver, SafariDriver and HtmlUnitDriver. For more information about each of these, including their relative strengths and weaknesses, please follow the links to the relevant pages.

*Q: HtmlUnit Supports Javascript So Why Doesn't the HtmlUnitDriver?*

A: Please see the HtmlUnitDriver page for more details, but the short answer is because no browser uses the JS engine used by HtmlUnit.

*Q: My XPath finds elements in one browser, but not in others. Why is this?*

A: The short answer is that each supported browser handles XPath slightly differently, and you're probably running into one of these differences. The long answer is on the XPathInWebDriver page.

*Q: What about support for languages other than Java?*

A: Support for other languages is planned, and we will be announcing these on the mailing list as they are checked in.

*Q: I'd like it if WebDriver did....*

A: If there's something that you'd like WebDriver to do, or you've found a bug, then please add an [http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/issues/list add an issue] to the WebDriver project page.
