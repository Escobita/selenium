#summary Getting started with WebDriver

= The 5 Minute Getting Started Guide =

Before you start:

 * CheckOut the latest version of the code, because there aren't any pre-packed binaries yet.
 * Follow the instructions in BuildingWebDriver.

Assuming that you've built everything and the source is located at {{{$WEBDRIVER_HOME}}}, and we're only going to use the HtmlUnitDriver to start with:

 * Start a new Java project in your favourite IDE
 * Add {{{$WEBDRIVER_HOME/common/build/webdriver-common.jar}}} to the {{{CLASSPATH}}}
 * Add {{{$WEBDRIVER_HOME/htmlunit/build/webdriver-htmlunit.jar}}} to the {{{CLASSPATH}}}
 * Add all the Jar files under {{{$WEBDRIVER_HOME/htmlunit/lib/runtime}}} to the {{{CLASSPATH}}}

We're now ready to write some code. Perhaps something that looks like:

{{{
package com.thoughtworks.webdriver.example;

import com.thoughtworks.webdriver.WebDriver;
import com.thoughtworks.webdriver.WebElement;
import com.thoughtworks.webdriver.htmlunit.HtmlUnitDriver;

public class Example  {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new instance of the html unit driver
        WebDriver driver = new HtmlUnitDriver();

        // And now use this to visit Google
        driver.get("http://www.google.com");

        // Find the text input element using a little XPath
        WebElement element = driver.selectElement("//input[@name='q']");

        // Enter something to search for
        element.setValue("Cheese!");

        // Now submit the form. WebDriver will find the form for us from the element
        element.submit();

        // Check the title of the page
        System.out.println("Page title is: " + driver.getTitle());
    }
}

}}}

Compile and run it. Congratulations, you've managed to get started with WebDriver!
