#summary Everything you wanted to know about the Internet Explorer driver

= Internet Explorer Driver =

This driver has been tested with IE 6 and 7 on XP, but should also work with IE 5.5.

== Installing ==

Before using this driver, it is necessary to register the COM component that forms the native part of the driver (see InternetExplorerDriverInternals for more information) This is done by running the {{{webdriver.reg}}} file found in the root of the "jobbie" directory. If you are compiling the C# code within Visual Studio, your IDE will do this for you.

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript

== Cons ==

 * Obviously the InternetExplorerDriver will only work on Windows!
 * Comparatively slow
