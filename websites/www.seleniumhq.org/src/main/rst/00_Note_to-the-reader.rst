Note to the Reader--*Docs Being Revised for Selenium 2.0*!
===========================================================
Hello, and welcome!  The Documentation Team would like to 
welcome you, and to thank you for being interested in Selenium.

*We are currently updating this document for the Selenium 2.0 release.*  This means
we are currently writing and editing new material, and revising old material.
While reading, you may experience typos or other minor errors.  If so, please be patient with us.
Rather than withholding information until it's finally complete, we are frequently checking-in
new writing and revisions as we go.  Still, we do check our facts first
and are confident the info we've submitted is accurate and useful.  Still, if you find an error, particularly
in one of our code examples, please let us know.  You can send an email directly to the Selenium Developers forum 
("selenium-developers" <selenium-developers@googlegroups.com>) with "Docs Error" in the subject line.

We have worked very, very hard on this document.  And, as just mentioned, we are once again working hard, 
on the new revision.  Why?  We absolutely believe 
this is the best tool for web-application testing.  We feel its extensibility 
and flexibility, along with its tight integration with the browser, is 
unmatched by available proprietary tools.  We are very excited to promote 
Selenium and, hopefully, to expand its user community.  In short, we really 
want to "get the word out" about Selenium.

We believe you will be similarly excited once you understand how Selenium 
approaches test automation.  It's quite different from other automation tools.  
Whether you are brand-new to Selenium, or have been using it for awhile, 
we believe this documentation will truly help to spread the knowledge around.  
We have aimed our writing so that those completely new to test automation 
can use this document as a stepping stone.  However, at the same time we have included
a number of advanced, test design topics that should be interesting to the
experienced software engineer.  In both cases we have written the "Sel-Docs" to help test engineers
of all abilities to quickly become productive writing your own Selenium tests.  
Experienced users and "newbies" alike will benefit from our Selenium User's Guide. 

                    Thanks very much for reading.
