= Introduction =

The Android Driver is new and not yet complete, however if you're willing to try it you might find these instructions useful. 

= Details =

= Building and Installing the software =
== Steps to build the software ==
Install IJetty on the device:
  * Download the source and build it following the instructions on the ijetty wiki page.
  * Put ijetty apk anywhere web accessible.
  * Download it from your android emulator or real device and install it.

Check out the code

{{{$ svn co http://webdriver.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ webdriver-source}}}

Build the code (everything but android)

{{{$ rake}}}

Build android

{{{$ mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dandroid.home=/home/berrada/android_sdk/android-sdk-linux/ -Dandroid-platform=platforms/android-1.5 -P android,windows}}}


== Installing the Android Driver ==
  * Start ijetty once you've launched it on the phone / emulator.
  * Make the {{{war}}} file available via a webserver, as ijetty needs to download the war file using http. Note: the war file  is located at {{{remote/server-android/target/}}} in the webdriver project.
  * Install the android.war  by downloading it through ijetty and set a relative path, say /wb. 
  * Install androidwebdriver.apk and download it on the android device or emulator. You can use the standard eclipse Android tools or the {{{adb}}} command from a command-line / terminal window.
