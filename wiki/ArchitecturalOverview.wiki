== Use a "Best Fit" Language ==

The key idea behind the various implementations of WebDriver is that each browser has a language that is most natural to use when attempting to drive it. All of the drivers are built with the idea that as much as possible should be done in this "best fit" language, while the implementation that the user sees is a thin wrapper around this. This may be represented as:

|| *Browser* || *"Best Fit" Language* ||
|| Firefox || Javascript in an XPCOM component ||
|| Internet Explorer || C++ mainly using the IE Automation APIs, but occasionally using other features of Windows ||
|| Safari || Apple Events ||

In addition, some of the languages that WebDriver is offered in (notably Java) have something that supports simulating a browser. These are generally modeled using composition.

== A Layered Design ==

In order to be useful, WebDriver must not make the user learn all the different implementation languages --- they don't care and they shouldn't have to. In order to be easy to write and maintain, as much logic as possible needs to be done in the "best fit" language of the browser. This naturally leads to a design where the API presented to the user is a thin wrapper around the core of each driver. 

One obvious benefit to this design is that writing a language binding for WebDriver becomes a matter of bridging to the "best fit" language. Another benefit is that it becomes very easy to work on a single driver, given you understand the "best fit" language. For example, it's possible to work on the FirefoxDriver completely independently of the InternetExplorerDriver. Better, once a feature in a driver is working in one binding language (for example, Java), it should be easy to add that support to other binding languages.
