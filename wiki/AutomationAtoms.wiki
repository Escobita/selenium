= Browser Automation Atoms =

Browser Automation Atoms are building blocks intended to be used by Selenium implementations. By using the same pieces throughout the codebase, rather than reimplementing required functionality in multiple places, the project can reduce the number of bugs found, and can simplify the process of adding new functionality and drivers.

== Using Atoms ==

There are two ways to make use of the automation atoms. 

# Using Google Closure
# As compiled fragments

The first of these approaches is useful when constructing a monolithic application, such as Selenium Core. The second approach is used in those drivers that are implemented natively and wish to use the atoms to interrogate the DOM (such as the InternetExplorerDriver).

== Atoms Summary ==

Each of the atoms listed here is exposed via the list *method name*, which delegates directly through to the *implementation method*. For information about the order in which arguments are to be passed, and for additional documentation, view the jsdoc of the implementation method.

|| *Method Name* || *Description* || *Implementation Method* ||
|| findElement || Find the first matching element in the DOM || bot.locators.findElement ||
|| findElements || Find all matching elements in the DOM || bot.locators.findElements ||
|| fire || Fire a specific, synthesized event || bot.events.fire ||
|| getAttribute || Get the value of an attribute or property of an element || bot.dom.getAttribute ||
|| getLocation || Get the absolute location of an element in the DOM || bot.dom.getLocation ||
|| getSize || Get the size of an element || bot.dom.getSize ||
|| isSelected || Would a user consider this element selected? || bot.dom.isSelected ||
