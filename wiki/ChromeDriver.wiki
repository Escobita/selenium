#summary Information about the Chrome Driver

= Chrome Driver =

Everything you ever wanted to know about the Chrome driver but were afraid to ask. See below for instructions on how to install the ChromeDriver.

Note that ChromeDriver is more experimental than others as it has not had time in the wild.  Please report any problems through the mailing list/issue tracker.  It is in the process of being made available - if you can't see it, try again tomorrow.

== Before Going Any Further ==

The ChromeDriver contains everything it needs in the JAR file. If you're just interested in using this driver, then all you need to do is put the {{{webdriver-chrome.jar}}} on your CLASSPATH, and WebDriver will do everything else for you.

You will need the *dev channel* release of Google Chrome installed (NOT the stable or beta).  You can get on the dev channel [http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel here].  Currently recommended is version 4.0.203.`*`.  There will be several breaking changes (as well as bug fixes! Hurrah!) in the next release, so if you have a choice, stay at 4.0.203

== Known issues ==

Sometimes Chrome does not grab focus when it is launched, and hangs.  If you can see this to be the case, click on the Chrome window and your tests should start running.  This will be fixed by [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20935 Chrome bug 20935].

Iframes which have no src attribute, i.e. <iframe src=""> or <iframe> are unsupported.  This will be fixed by [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20773 Chrome bug 20773], but is not likely to happen until at least October 2009.

Switching focus in the page (i.e. element switchTo) is currently unsupported.

Only one instance at a time will run.  This will be fixed when the fix to [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11547 Chrome bug 11547] is patched into the dev channel (probably this week).

File uploading using <input type="file"> elements is currently unsupported.

=== Additionally, on Mac and Linux: ===

Native events are unsupported.  Clicking will work, but only fires limited events.  Typing will work if you are only typing lower case ASCII characters, but will not fire any events.  This should be fixed by mid-October 2009.

Deleting cookies is unsupported.  This is due to a bug in Chrome, and will be fixed when the fix to [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=14734 Chrome bug 14734] is patched into the dev channel (probably this week).

=== And just on Mac: ===

Unfortunately, you cannot have any Chrome windows of your own open while testing.  This should be fixed by [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20935 Chrome bug 20935]

== Important System Properties ==

The following system properties (read using {{{System.getProperty()}}} and set using {{{System.setProperty()}}} in Java code or the "{{{-DpropertyName=value}}}" command line flag) are used by the ChromeDriver:

|| *Property* || *What it means* ||
|| webdriver.chrome.bin || The location of the binary used to control chrome. ||

Normally the Firefox binary is assumed to be in the default location for your particular operating system:

|| *OS* || *Expected Location of Chrome* ||
|| Linux || /usr/bin/google-chrome ||
|| Mac || /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome *or* /User/:username/:as_to_the_left ||
|| Windows XP || %HOMEPATH%\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe ||
|| Windows Vista || C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe ||

== Installing a Downloaded Binary ==

The "wedriver-chrome.zip" which may be downloaded from the website, contains all the dependencies (including the common and remote libraries) required to run the ChromeDriver. In order to use it, copy all the "jar" files on to your classpath.

== Installing the Quick Way From Source (with Ruby) ==

If you're doing development work, the test suites are arranged in such a way as to use the version of webdriver found in {{{chrome/src/extension}}}.  It will magically copy over build/Win32/Debug/npchromedriver.dll into the extension if you're on Windows.  Make sure that this dll has been compiled using Visual Studio/msbuild (it's part of WebDriver.sln).  Note that {{{rake clean}}} will delete this file, so you will need to recompile after {{{rake clean}}}ing.

This assumes that your installation of chrome is pretty standard (i.e. where the installer puts it).  If your chrome is installed in a custom location, then open up the {{{SingleTestSuite}}} and add a system property to tell the ChromeDriver where your Chrome binary is:

{{{System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.bin", "d:\\apps\\google\\chrome.exe");}}}

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript
 * Also probably a decent test for rendering of Safari/other WebKit based browsers, though not their Javascript (as it uses its own V8 Javascript engine)

== Cons ==
 
 * Slower than the HtmlUnitDriver
