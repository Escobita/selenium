See below for instructions on how to install the ChromeDriver. 

Note that ChromeDriver is one of the newest drivers. Please report any problems through the mailing list/issue tracker.

== Before Going Any Further ==

The ChromeDriver contains everything it needs in the JAR file. If you're just interested in using this driver, then all you need to do is put the {{{webdriver-chrome.jar}}} or {{{webdriver-all.jar}}} on your CLASSPATH, and WebDriver will do everything else for you.

The ChromeDriver works with any version of Google Chrome >= 4.0.

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript
 * Because Chrome is a Webkit-based browser, the ChromeDriver may allow you to verify that your site works in Safari. Note that since Chrome uses its own V8 javascript engine rather than Safari's Nitro engine, javascript execution may differ.

== Cons ==
 
 * Slower than the HtmlUnitDriver

== Known issues ==

Iframes which have no src attribute, i.e. <iframe src=""> or <iframe> are unsupported.  This will be fixed by [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=20773 Chrome bug 20773], but is not likely to happen until at least October 2009.

Only one instance at a time will run.  This is due to a bug in Chrome on Linux and Mac [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11547 Chrome bug 11547].  On Windows, you can apply [http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/ChromeDriverMultipleInstancePatch.diff this patch] to the WebDriver source which will enable multiple instances to run concurrently, but this version of the WebDriver source will then not work on Linux or Mac.

File uploading using <input type="file"> elements is currently unsupported. We aim to support this on Windows in the near future.

Hovering and dragging and dropping are currently unsupported.

ChromeDriver.get(url) will clear the navigating history of your session (ChromeDriver.navigate().back() and ChromeDriver.navigate().forward will stop working).

=== Additionally, on Mac and Linux: ===

Native events are unsupported.  Clicking will work, but only fires limited events.  Typing will only fire a limited range of events, and only works on TEXTAREA and INPUT elements. We aim to have this problem solved by late November (2009: there's a promise for posterity)

== Important System Properties ==

The following system properties (read using {{{System.getProperty()}}} and set using {{{System.setProperty()}}} in Java code or the "{{{-DpropertyName=value}}}" command line flag) are used by the ChromeDriver:

|| *Property* || *What it means* ||
|| webdriver.chrome.bin || The location of the binary used to control chrome. ||
|| webdriver.reap_profile || Should be "true" if temporary files and profiles should not be deleted ||

Normally the Chrome binary is assumed to be in the default location for your particular operating system:

|| *OS* || *Expected Location of Chrome* ||
|| Linux || /usr/bin/google-chrome ||
|| Mac || /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome *or* /User/:username/:as_to_the_left ||
|| Windows XP || %HOMEPATH%\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe ||
|| Windows Vista || C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe ||

== Installing a Downloaded Binary ==

The "wedriver-all.zip" which may be [http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list downloaded from the website], contains all the dependencies required to run the ChromeDriver. In order to use it, copy all the "jar" files on to your CLASSPATH.

== Installing the Quick Way From Source ==

If you're doing development work on the ChromeDriver itself, the test suites are arranged in such a way as to use the version of webdriver found in {{{chrome/src/extension}}}.  It will automatically (automagically?) copy over {{{build/Win32/Debug/npchromedriver.dll}}} into the extension if you're on Windows.  Make sure that this DLL has been compiled using Visual Studio/msbuild (it's part of WebDriver.sln).  Note that {{{rake clean}}} will delete this file, so you will need to recompile after {{{rake clean}}}ing.

The underlying assumption is that your installation of chrome is pretty standard (i.e. where the installer puts it).  If your chrome is installed in a custom location, then open up the {{{SingleTestSuite}}} and add a system property to tell the ChromeDriver where your Chrome binary is:

{{{System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.bin", "d:\\apps\\google\\chrome.exe");}}}
