#summary What we're doing with the build file

= WebDriver's Build System =

WebDriver is built using Rake. Rather than being a straight series of tasks, we've layered a declarative layer on top of this. That is, rather than:

{{{
task foo => [:bar, :baz]
}}}

the webdriver Rakefile has lines such as:

{{{
java_jar(:name => "webdriver-common",
         :srcs   => "common/src/java/**/*.java"
}}}

This boils down to a call of the method "java_jar", passing in a Hash containing the details required to build the target. Behind the scenes, this sets up a normal rake task called "webdriver-common" which depends on the file "build/webdriver-common.jar", which in turn depends on the sources. This means that at the end of the day _we're just a Rakefile_.

== Implicit Targets and Outputs ==

The following implicit targets and outputs are generated:

|| *Method name * || * :name value* || * Called with * || *Output* || * What it does * ||
|| java_jar || "foo" || rake foo || build/foo.jar || Builds the jar from the sources ||
|| java_jar || "foo" || rake foo_zip || build/foo.zip || Packages the output of target, with dependencies, into a zip || 

== Future Plans ==

At the moment, the Rakefile is monolithic and hard to understand. We'd like to "shatter" the various pieces into subdirectories.
