#summary Instructions and guidance for building WebDriver in cygwin
#labels WebDriver

= Prerequisites =

To use rake, you need to have installed the Ruby package with cygwin.  If you didn't (check this by running `which ruby` - it should point at /usr/bin/ruby.  If it's something beginning with /cygdrive, you have not installed cygwin Ruby.  You will probably get errors complaining about "No medium" if you try to run non-cygwin Ruby).

Make sure your environment variable $RUBYOPT is blank (specifically, does not contain -rubygems).

You then need to install RubyGems.  Do this by:
 # Download the RubyGems tarball from [http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/ Ruby Forge]
 # Unpack the tarball (tar xvfz rubygems-*.tgz)
 # Navigate to the unpacked tarball
 # Run the following command: {{{ruby setup.rb install}}}
 # Update RubyGems by running the following: {{{gem update --system}}} (You may need to do this twice).

Then install rake.  Do this by: {{{gem install --remote rake}}}

`which rake` should now show /usr/bin/rake

You may need to restart cygwin at this stage.

You should now be able to build webdriver from rake.  See DeveloperTips for more information about building from rake.
