= Developer Tips =

== Running an Individual Test ==

When developing WebDriver, it is common to want to run a single test rather than the entire test suite for a particular driver. In order to do this, open the {{{SingleTestSuite}}} class. There are some key fields that you may comment out (or include!):

|| *Method Name* || *What It Means* ||
|| addSourceDir || Adds a source directory relative to the root of trunk (that is, the directory containing the Rakefile) ||
|| usingDriver || Takes the fully qualified name of the driver class. This class must have a no-arg constructor and must implement the WebDriver interface ||
|| keepDriverInstance || Without this method, a new instance of the chosen driver will be instantiated per-test ||
|| onlyRun || The class name (not fully qualified) of the TestCase to run ||
|| method || The name of a particular method within the TestCase given by "onlyRun" ||

== Using Rake ==

Rake is very similar to using other build tools such as "make" or "ant". You can specify a "target" to run by adding it as a parameter, and you can add more than one target at a time. Note that since WebDriver does not rely on ruby being installed and uses JRuby, rake should *not* be involved directly - use the _go_ script instead. For example, in order to clean the build and then build and run the HtmlUnitDriver tests:

{{{
./go clean test_htmlunit
}}}

The default target that's used will compile the code and run all the tests. More interesting targets are:

|| *Target* || *Description* ||
|| clean || Delete the contents of the build directory, removing all compiled artifacts ||
|| test || Compile the dependencies of and run all the tests for the HtmlUnitDriver, FirefoxDriver, and InternetExplorerDriver as well as the support library's tests ||
|| firefox || Compile the FirefoxDriver ||
|| htmlunit || Compile the HtmlUnitDriver ||
|| ie || Compile the InternetExplorerDriver. This won't compile the C++ on a non-Windows system, but will always compile the Java, no matter which OS you happen to be using ||
|| support || Guess what this does :) ||
|| test_htmlunit || Compile the dependencies and then run the tests for the HtmlUnitDriver. The same "test_x" pattern can be followed for all the compilation targets in this table. ||
