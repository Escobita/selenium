= Firefox Driver =

Firefox driver is included in the selenium-server-stanalone.jar available in the downloads. The driver comes in the form of an xpi (firefox extension) which is added to the firefox profile when you start a new instance of FirefoxDriver.

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript
 * Faster than the InternetExplorerDriver

== Cons ==
 
 * Slower than the HtmlUnitDriver


== Important System Properties ==

The following system properties (read using {{{System.getProperty()}}} and set using {{{System.setProperty()}}} in Java code or the "{{{-DpropertyName=value}}}" command line flag) are used by the FirefoxDriver:

|| *Property* || *What it means* ||
|| webdriver.firefox.bin || The location of the binary used to control firefox. ||
|| webdriver.firefox.profile || The name of the profile to use when starting firefox. This defaults to webdriver creating an anonymous profile ||
|| webdriver.reap_profile || Should be "true" if temporary files and profiles should not be deleted ||
|| webdriver.firefox.useExisting || *Never use in production* Use a running instance of firefox if one is present ||
|| webdriver.development || *Never use in production* Indicates that we're in development mode. ||

Normally the Firefox binary is assumed to be in the default location for your particular operating system:

|| *OS* || *Expected Location of Firefox* ||
|| Linux || firefox (found using "which") ||
|| Mac || /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox ||
|| Windows || %PROGRAMFILES%\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe ||

By default, the Firefox driver creates an anonymous profile

== Running with firebug ==

Download the firebug xpi file from mozilla and start the profile as follows:
{{{
   File file = new File("firebug-1.5.4.xpi");
   FirefoxProfile firefoxProfile = new FirefoxProfile();
   firefoxProfile.addExtension(file);
   WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(firefoxProfile);
}}}
