= Internet Explorer Driver =

This driver has been tested with IE 6, 7, 8 and 9 on appropriate combinations of XP, Vista and Windows 7.

== Installing ==

Simply add the {{{webdriver-all.jar}}} or {{{webdriver-ie.jar}}} to your CLASSPATH. You do not need to run an installer before using the InternetExplorerDriver, though some configuration is required.

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript

== Cons ==

 * Obviously the InternetExplorerDriver will only work on Windows!
 * Comparatively slow (though still pretty snappy :)

== Required Configuration ==

 * On IE 7 or higher on Windows Vista or Windows 7, you must set the Protected Mode settings for each zone to be the same value. The value can be on or off, as long as it is the same for every zone. To set the Protected Mode settings, choose "Internet Options..." from the Tools menu, and click on the Security tab. For each zone, there will be a check box at the bottom of the tab labeled "Enable Protected Mode".
