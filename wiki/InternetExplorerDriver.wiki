= Internet Explorer Driver =

This driver has been tested with IE 6, 7 and 8 on XP, but should also work with IE 5.5. It has also been successfully tested on Vista

== Installing ==

Simply add the {{{webdriver-all.jar}}} or {{{webdriver-ie.jar}}} to your CLASSPATH. You do not need to run an installer before using the InternetExplorerDriver, though some configuration is required.

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript

== Cons ==

 * Obviously the InternetExplorerDriver will only work on Windows!
 * Comparatively slow (though still pretty snappy :)

== Required Configuration ==

 * Add every site you intend to visit to your "Trusted Sites" If you do not do this, then you will not be able to interact with the page.
