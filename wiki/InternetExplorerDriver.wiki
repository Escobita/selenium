= Internet Explorer Driver =

This driver has been tested with IE 6, 7, 8 and 9 on appropriate combinations of XP, Vista and Windows 7. 

The driver supports running 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the browser, but the choice of how to determine which "bit-ness" to use in launching the browser is left to the language bindings. However, the general rule of thumb is that if the code that instantiates the driver is running in a 32-bit process, the 32-bit version of IE will be launched. Similarly, if the code intantiating the driver is in a 64-bit process, the 64-bit version of IE will be launched.

== Installing ==

Simply add the {{{webdriver-all.jar}}} or {{{webdriver-ie.jar}}} to your CLASSPATH. You do not need to run an installer before using the InternetExplorerDriver, though some configuration is required.

== Pros ==

 * Runs in a real browser and supports Javascript

== Cons ==

 * Obviously the InternetExplorerDriver will only work on Windows!
 * Comparatively slow (though still pretty snappy :)

== Required Configuration ==

 * On IE 7 or higher on Windows Vista or Windows 7, you must set the Protected Mode settings for each zone to be the same value. The value can be on or off, as long as it is the same for every zone. To set the Protected Mode settings, choose "Internet Options..." from the Tools menu, and click on the Security tab. For each zone, there will be a check box at the bottom of the tab labeled "Enable Protected Mode".
 * The browser zoom level must be set to 100% so that the native mouse events can be set to the correct coordinates.
