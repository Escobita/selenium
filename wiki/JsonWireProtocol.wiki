<font size=6>*The !WebDriver Wire Protocol*</font>

<font size=3>*Status:* _DRAFT_</font>

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

All implementations of WebDriver that communicate with the browser, or a RemoteWebDriver server shall use a common wire protocol. This wire protocol defines a [http://www.google.com?q=RESTful+web+service RESTful web service] using [http://www.json.org JSON] over HTTP.

The protocol will assume that the WebDriver API has been "flattened", but there is an expectation that client implementations will take a more Object-Oriented approach, as demonstrated in the existing Java API. The wire protocol is implemented in request/response pairs of "commands" and "responses".

== Basic Terms and Concepts ==

<dl>
<dt>
==== Client ====
</dt>
<dd>The machine on which the !WebDriver API is being used.

</dd>
<dt>
==== Server ====
</dt>
<dd>The machine running the RemoteWebDriver. This term may also refer to a specific browser that implements the wire protocol directly, such as the FirefoxDriver or IPhoneDriver.

</dd>
<dt>
==== Session ====
</dt>
<dd>The server should maintain one browser per session. Commands sent to a session will be directed to the corresponding browser.

</dd>
<dt>
==== !WebElement ====
</dt>
<dd>An object in the !WebDriver API that represents a DOM element on the page.

</dd>
<dt>
==== !WebElement JSON Object ====
</dt>
<dd>The JSON representation of a !WebElement for transmission over the wire. This object will have the following properties:

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| ELEMENT || string || The opaque ID assigned to the element by the server. This ID should be used in all subsequent commands issued against the element. ||

</dd>

<dt>
==== Capabilities JSON Object ====
</dt>
<dd>Not all server implementations will support every !WebDriver feature. Therefore, the client and server should use JSON objects with the properties listed below when describing which features a session supports.

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| browserName || string || The name of the browser being used; should be one of `{chrome|firefox|htmlunit|internet explorer|iphone}`. ||
|| version || string || The browser version, or the empty string if unknown. ||
|| platform || string || A key specifying which platform the browser is running on. This value should be one of `{WINDOWS|XP|VISTA|MAC|LINUX|UNIX}`. When requesting a new session, the client may specify `ANY` to indicate any available platform may be used. ||
|| javascriptEnabled || boolean || Whether the session supports executing user supplied JavaScript in the context of the current page. ||
|| takesScreenshot || boolean || Whether the session supports taking screenshots of the current page. ||
|| handlesAlerts || boolean || Whether the session can interact with modal popups, such as `window.alert` and `window.confirm`. ||
|| databaseEnabled || boolean || Whether the session can interact database storage. ||
|| locationContextEnabled || boolean || Whether the session can set and query the browser's location context. ||
|| applicationCacheEnabled || boolean || Whether the session can interact with the application cache. ||
|| browserConnectionEnabled || boolean || Whether the session can query for the browser's connectivity and disable it if desired. ||
|| cssSelectorsEnabled || boolean || Whether the session supports CSS selectors when searching for elements. ||
|| webStorageEnabled || boolean || Whether the session supports interactions with [http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-webstorage-20091029/ storage objects]. || 
|| rotatable || boolean || Whether the session can rotate the current page's current layout between portrait and landscape orientations (only applies to mobile platforms). ||
|| acceptSslCerts || boolean || Whether the session should accept all SSL certs by default. ||
|| nativeEvents || boolean || Whether the session is capable of generating native events when simulating user input. ||


</dd>

<dt>
==== Desired Capabilities ====
</dt>
<dd>A Capabilities JSON Object sent by the client describing the capabilities a new session created by the server should possess. Any omitted keys implicitly indicate the corresponding capability is irrelevant.</dd>

<dt>
==== Actual Capabilities ====
</dt>
<dd>A Capabilities JSON Object returned by the server describing what features a session actually supports. Any omitted keys implicitly indicate the corresponding capability is not supported.</dd>

<dt>
==== Cookie JSON Object ====
</dt>
<dd>
A JSON object describing a Cookie.

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| name || string || The name of the cookie. ||
|| value || string || The cookie value. ||
|| path || string || (Optional) The cookie path.^1^ ||
|| domain || string || (Optional) The domain the cookie is visible to.^1^ ||
|| secure || boolean || (Optional) Whether the cookie is a secure cookie.^1^ ||
|| expiry || number || (Optional) When the cookie expires, specified in seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.^1^ ||

^1^ When returning Cookie objects, the server should only omit an optional field if it is incapable of providing the information.</dd>

</dl>

= Messages =

== Commands ==

!WebDriver command messages should conform to the [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5 HTTP/1.1 request specification]. Although the server may be extended to respond to other content-types, the wire protocol dictates that all commands accept a content-type of `application/json;charset=UTF-8`. Likewise, the message bodies for POST and PUT request must use an `application/json;charset=UTF-8` content-type.

Each command in the WebDriver service will be mapped to an HTTP method at a specific path. Path segments prefixed with a colon (:) indicate that segment is a variable used to further identify the underlying resource. For example, consider an arbitrary resource mapped as:
{{{
GET /favorite/color/:name
}}}
Given this mapping, the server should respond to GET requests sent to "/favorite/color/Jack" and "/favorite/color/Jill", with the variable `:name` set to "Jack" and "Jill", respectively.

== Responses ==

Command responses shall be sent as [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6 HTTP/1.1 response messages]. If the remote server must return a 4xx response, the response body shall have a Content-Type of text/plain and the message body shall be a descriptive message of the bad request. For all other cases, if a response includes a message body, it must have a Content-Type of application/json;charset=UTF-8 and will be a JSON object with the following properties:

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| sessionId || string|null || An opaque handle used by the server to determine where to route session-specific commands. This ID should be included in all future session-commands in place of the :sessionId path segment variable. ||
|| status || number || A status code summarizing the result of the command. A non-zero value indicates that the command failed. ||
|| value || `*` || The response JSON value. ||

=== Response Status Codes ===

The wire protocol will inherit its status codes from those used by the InternetExplorerDriver:

|| *Code* || *Summary* || *Detail* ||
|| 0 || `Success` || The command executed successfully. ||
|| 7 || `NoSuchElement` || An element could not be located on the page using the given search parameters. ||
|| 8 || `NoSuchFrame` || A request to switch to a frame could not be satisfied because the frame could not be found. ||
|| 9 || `UnknownCommand` || The requested resource could not be found, or a request was received using an HTTP method that is not supported by the mapped resource. ||
|| 10 || `StaleElementReference` || An element command failed because the referenced element is no longer attached to the DOM. ||
|| 11 || `ElementNotVisible` || An element command could not be completed because the element is not visible on the page. ||
|| 12 || `InvalidElementState` || An element command could not be completed because the element is in an invalid state (e.g. attempting to click a disabled element). ||
|| 13 || `UnknownError` || An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. ||
|| 15 || `ElementIsNotSelectable` || An attempt was made to select an element that cannot be selected. ||
|| 17 || `JavaScriptError` || An error occurred while executing user supplied !JavaScript. ||
|| 19 || `XPathLookupError` || An error occurred while searching for an element by XPath. ||
|| 23 || `NoSuchWindow` || A request to switch to a different window could not be satisfied because the window could not be found. ||
|| 24 || `InvalidCookieDomain` || An illegal attempt was made to set a cookie under a different domain than the current page. ||
|| 25 || `UnableToSetCookie` || A request to set a cookie's value could not be satisfied. ||
|| 28 || `Timeout` || A command did not complete before its timeout expired. ||

The client should interpret a 404 Not Found response from the server as an "Unknown command" response. All other 4xx and 5xx responses from the server that do not define a status field should be interpreted as "Unknown error" responses.

== Error Handling ==

There are two levels of error handling specified by the wire protocol: invalid requests and failed commands.

=== Invalid Requests ===

All invalid requests should result in the server returning a 4xx HTTP response. The response Content-Type should be set to text/plain and the message body should be a descriptive error message. The categories of invalid requests are as follows:

<dl>
<dt>*Unknown Commands*</dt>
<dd>If the server receives a command request whose path is not mapped to a resource in the REST service, it should respond with a `404 Not Found` message.

</dd>
<dt>*Unimplemented Commands*</dt>
<dd>Every server implementing the WebDriver wire protocol must respond to every defined command. If an individual command has not been implemented on the server, the server should respond with a `501 Not Implemented` error message. Note this is the only error in the Invalid Request category that does not return a `4xx` status code.

</dd>
<dt>*Variable Resource Not Found*</dt>
<dd>If a request path maps to a variable resource, but that resource does not exist, then the server should respond with a `404 Not Found`. For example, if ID `my-session` is not a valid session ID on the server, and a command is sent to `GET /session/my-session HTTP/1.1`, then the server should gracefully return a `404`.

</dd>
<dt>*Invalid Command Method*</dt>
<dd>If a request path maps to a valid resource, but that resource does not respond to the request method, the server should respond with a `405 Method Not Allowed`. The response must include an Allows header with a list of the allowed methods for the requested resource.

</dd>
<dt>*Missing Command Parameters*</dt>
<dd>If a POST/PUT command maps to a resource that expects a set of JSON parameters, and the response body does not include one of those parameters, the server should respond with a `400 Bad Request`. The response body should list the missing parameters.

</dd>
</dl>

=== Failed Commands ===

If a request maps to a valid command and contains all of the expected parameters in the request body, yet fails to execute successfully, then the server should send a 500 Internal Server Error. This response should have a Content-Type of `application/json;charset=UTF-8` and the response body should be a well formed JSON response object.

The response status should be one of the defined status codes and the response value should be another JSON object with detailed information for the failing command:

|| Key || Type || Description ||
|| message || string || A descriptive message for the command failure. ||
|| screen || string || (Optional) If included, a screenshot of the current page as a base64 encoded string. ||
|| class || string || (Optional) If included, specifies the fully qualified class name for the exception that was thrown when the command failed. ||
|| stackTrace || array || (Optional) If included, specifies an array of JSON objects describing the stack trace for the exception that was thrown when the command failed. The zeroeth element of the array represents the top of the stack. ||

Each JSON object in the stackTrace array must contain the following properties:

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| fileName || string || The name of the source file containing the line represented by this frame. ||
|| className || string || The fully qualified class name for the class active in this frame. If the class name cannot be determined, or is not applicable for the language the server is implemented in, then this property should be set to the empty string. ||
|| methodName || string || The name of the method active in this frame, or the empty string if unknown/not applicable. ||
|| lineNumber || number || The line number in the original source file for the frame, or 0 if unknown. ||

= Resource Mapping =

Resources in the WebDriver REST service are mapped to individual URL patterns. Each resource may respond to one or more HTTP request methods. If a resource responds to a GET request, then it should also respond to HEAD requests. All resources should respond to OPTIONS requests with an `Allow` header field, whose value is a list of all methods that resource responds to.

If a resource is mapped to a URL containing a variable path segment name, that path segment should be used to further route the request. Variable path segments are indicated in the resource mapping by a colon-prefix. For example, consider the following:
{{{
/favorite/color/:person
}}}
A resource mapped to this URL should parse the value of the `:person` path segment to further determine how to respond to the request. If this resource received a request for `/favorite/color/Jack`, then it should return Jack's favorite color. Likewise, the server should return Jill's favorite color for any requests to `/favorite/color/Jill`.

Two resources may only be mapped to the same URL pattern if one of those resources' patterns contains variable path segments, and the other does not. In these cases, the server should always route requests to the resource whose path is the best match for the request. Consider the following two resource paths:

  # `/session/:sessionId/element/active`
  # `/session/:sessionId/element/:id`

Given these mappings, the server should always route requests whose final path segment is active to the first resource. All other requests should be routed to second.

Inject a snippet of !JavaScript into the page for execution in the context of the currently selected frame. The executed script is assumed to be synchronous and the result of evaluating the script is returned to the client.

The `script` argument defines the script to execute in the form of a function body.  The value returned by that function will be returned to the client.  The function will be invoked with the provided `args` array and the values may be accessed via the `arguments` object in the order specified.

Arguments may be any JSON-primitive, array, or JSON object.  JSON objects that define a [#WebElement_JSON_Object WebElement reference] will be converted to the corresponding DOM element. Likewise, any !WebElements in the script result will be returned to the client as [#WebElement_JSON_Object WebElement JSON objects].</dd>

Inject a snippet of !JavaScript into the page for execution in the context of the currently selected frame. The executed script is assumed to be asynchronous and must signal that is done by invoking the provided callback, which is always provided as the final argument to the function.  The value to this callback will be returned to the client.

Asynchronous script commands may not span page loads.  If an `unload` event is fired while waiting for a script result, an error should be returned to the client.

The `script` argument defines the script to execute in teh form of a function body.  The function will be invoked with the provided `args` array and the values may be accessed via the `arguments` object in the order specified. The final argument will always be a callback function that must be invoked to signal that the script has finished.

Arguments may be any JSON-primitive, array, or JSON object.  JSON objects that define a [#WebElement_JSON_Object WebElement reference] will be converted to the corresponding DOM element. Likewise, any !WebElements in the script result will be returned to the client as [#WebElement_JSON_Object WebElement JSON objects].</dd>

<dd>Send a sequence of key strokes to an element.

Any UTF-8 character may be specified, however, if the server does not support native key events, it should simulate key strokes for a standard US keyboard layout. The Unicode [http://unicode.org/faq/casemap_charprop.html#8 Private Use Area] code points, 0xE000-0xF8FF, are used to represent pressable, non-text  keys (see table below).

The server must process the key sequence as follows:
  * Each key that appears on the keyboard without requiring modifiers are sent as a keydown followed by a key up.
  * If the server does not support native events and must simulate key strokes with !JavaScript, it must generate keydown, keypress, and keyup events, in that order. The keypress event should only be fired when the corresponding key is for a printable character.
  * If a key requires a modifier key (e.g. "!" on a standard US keyboard), the sequence is: <var>modifier</var> down, <var>key</var> down, <var>key</var> up, <var>modifier</var> up, where <var>key</var> is the ideal unmodified key value (using the previous example, a "1").
  * Modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and Command/Meta) are assumed to be "sticky"; each modifier should be held down (e.g. only a keydown event) until either the modifier is encountered again in the sequence, or the `NULL` (U+E000) key is encountered.
  * Each key sequence is terminated with an implicit `NULL` key. Subsequently, all depressed modifier keys must be released (with corresponding keyup events) at the end of the sequence.
