= OperaDriver =

!OperaDriver is a vendor-supported !WebDriver implementation developed by [http://opera.com/ Opera Software] and volunteers that implements !WebDriver's [JsonWireProtocol wire protocol].

== Requirements ==

The !OperaDriver uses the [http://dragonfly.opera.com/app/scope-interface/ Scope interface] (same as for [http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/ Dragonfly]) to communicate directly with Opera from Java.  Consequently, the !OperaDriver is only compatible with Opera version 11.5 or newer.

The server expects you to have Opera installed in the default location for each system:

|| *OS* || *Expected Location of Opera* ||
|| Linux || /usr/bin/opera ||
|| Mac || /Applications/Opera.app/Contents/MacOS/Opera ||
|| Windows || \%PROGRAMFILES%\Opera\opera.exe ||

However, you can override this and specify a custom location to Opera by setting the `OPERA_PATH` environmental variable which you can read more about under [#Settings].

== Getting Started ==

To get set up [http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list please download] either _selenium-server_ or _selenium-server-standalone_ and make sure you have a fairly recent version of Opera.  All you need to do is to create a new `OperaDriver` instance:

{{{
WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();
driver.navigate().to("http://www.opera.com/");
}}}

=== Running the server as a standalone process ===

Since the !OperaDriver implements the wire protocol, it is fully compatible with any RemoteWebDriver client.  Simply start up your server, create a client, and away you go:

{{{
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver("http://localhost:9515", DesiredCapabilities.opera());
driver.navigate().to("http://www.opera.com/");
}}}

=== Using the Ruby bindings ===

_[RubyBindings selenium-webdriver]_, the Ruby bindings for Selenium 2/!WebDriver also support Opera out of the box.  First, install the gem:

{{{
gem install selenium-webdriver
}}}

Next, [http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list download the selenium-server-standalone] jar and set environmental variable `SELENIUM_SERVER_JAR` to point to its location:

{{{
export SELENIUM_SERVER_JAR=~/server-standalone.jar
}}}

Then all you have to do is to create a new instance of `Selenium::WebDriver`:

{{{
require 'rubygems'
require 'selenium-webdriver'

driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :opera
driver.navigate.to 'http://opera.com/'
}}}

If you prefer using the Watir API, you can have a look at the [http://rubygems.org/gems/watir-webdriver watir-webdriver] gem.

== Advanced Usage ==

=== Desired capabilities ===

You can use the !DesiredCapabilites class to set some settings inside OperaDriver. The capabilities we support are:

==== opera.logging.level ====

(String) How verbose the logging should be.  Available levels are: SEVERE (highest value),
WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST (lowest value), ALL.  Default is INFO.

==== opera.logging.file ====

(String) Where to send the output of the logging.  Default is to not write to file.

==== opera.binary ====

(String) Path to the Opera binary to use.  If not specified, OperaDriver will
guess the path to your Opera installation (typically `/usr/bin/opera`> or
`C:\Program Files\Opera\opera.exe`).

==== opera.host ====

(String) The host Opera should connect to.  Unless you're starting Opera manually you won't
need this.

==== opera.port ====

(Integer) The port to Opera should connect to.  0 = Random, -1 = Opera default (for use with
Opera < 12).

==== opera.launcher ====

(String) Path to the launcher binary to use.  The launcher is a gateway between OperaDriver and
the Opera browser, and is being used for controlling the binary and taking external
screenshots.  If left blank, OperaDriver will use the launcher supplied with the package.

==== opera.arguments ====

(String) Arguments to pass to Opera, separated by spaces.  See `opera -help`
for available command-line switches.

==== opera.profile ====

(String) Directory to use for the Opera profile. If null a random temporary directory is used.
If "", an empty string, then the default autotest profile directory is used.

==== opera.idle ====

(Boolean) Whether to use Opera's alternative implicit wait implementation.  It will use an
in-browser heuristic to guess when a page has finished loading, allowing us with great accuracy
tell whether there are any planned events in the document.  This functionality is useful for
very simple test cases, but not designed for real-world testing.  It is disabled by default.

==== opera.display ====

(Integer) The X display to use.  (Only works on UNIX-like OSes.)

==== opera.autostart ====

(Boolean) Whether to auto-start the Opera binary.  If false, OperaDriver will wait for a
connection from the browser.  Go to "opera:debug", enter the correct port number, and hit
"Connect" to connect manually.

==== opera.no_restart ====

(Boolean) Whether to restart.

==== opera.no_quit ====

(Boolean) Whether to quit Opera when OperaDriver is shut down.  If enabled, it will keep the
browser running after the driver is shut down.

==== opera.guess_binary_path ====

(Boolean) Whether to guess the path to Opera if it isn't set in `opera.binary`.


==== opera.binary_profile ====

(String) The profile configuration we are using, for example "desktop" or "core-gogi".

=== Settings ===

To specify such things as a custom location of the Opera binary and command-line arguments you may use environmental variables or the !OperaDriverSettings object.  This is a list of the environmental variables which can be set on any OS:

 * `OPERA_PATH`: The full path to the Opera binary.
 * `OPERA_ARGS`: A space-delimited list of arguments to pass on to Opera, e.g. `-nowindow`, `-dimensions 1600x1200`, &c.
 * `OPERA_IDLE`: If set to a truthy value ("true", "1") you will enable a built-in browser-side checker for when a page is finished loading.
 * `OPERA_LAUNCHER`: Full path to the Opera binary launcher, typically located in `~/.launcher/launcher-*` on GNU/Linux and Mac.

You may also pass in the !OperaDriverSettings object to the constructor in OperaDriver:

{{{
OperaDriverSettings settings = new OperaDriverSettings();
settings.setOperaBinaryLocation("/path/to/opera");
settings.setOperaBinaryArguments("-nowindow -someothervalue");
settings.setUseOperaIdle(true);
settings.setOperaLauncherXvfbDisplay(8);
WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver(settings);
}}}

== opera-launcher ==

!OperaDriver extracts a program called opera-launcher to a sub-directory in your home directory called _.launcher_.  This is a server spawned by OperaDriver which handles the management of the Opera browser binary, as well as taking screenshots.  OperaDriver communicates with the launcher over the !OperaLauncherProtocol, which is not related to the !Scope protocol in any way.

The opera-launcher is a way to circumvent various problems related to process management on Windows and taking reliable, external screenshots for testing.

== Supported Opera versions ==

=== Desktop ===

This is a list of the official Opera Desktop versions we support:

|| *Version* || *Workaround/tweaks needed* ||
|| 12.00 || _(Not released yet.)_ ||
|| 11.51 || Set `opera.port` to 0 and `opera.profile` to null to enable parallelization on GNU/Linux ||
|| 11.50 ||  ||
|| 11.11 ||  ||
|| 11.10 ||  ||
|| 11.01 || `-autotestmode` command-line argument is not supported, use a [#Wrapper_script wrapper script] ||
|| 11.00 || `-autotestmode` command-line argument is not supported, use a [#Wrapper_script wrapper script] ||

The ability to run multiple instances of Opera in parallell is currently only
supported in the latest Opera version 11.51 on GNU/Linux (see comment above),
but support for Windows and Mac is planned in Opera 12.

We don't officially support Opera versions prior to 11.00, although it should
be possible to get OperaDriver working on Opera 10.6 with some minor tweaks.

==== Wrapper script ====

Some Opera versions don't accept the `-autotestmode` or `-debugproxy arguments`.  Since

{{{
#!/bin/sh
# Wrapper to prevent the -autotestmode argument reaching this version of Opera
# which doesn't support it.
`dirname $0`/opera
}}}

== Known Issues ==

 * Currently limited to one instance of Opera per machine
 * Problems with Operas with IME feature enabled (Opera Mobile, Android, bream)
 * Not using !WebDriver atoms yet
 * !JavaScript JIT is disabled for injected scripts
