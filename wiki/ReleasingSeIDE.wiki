= Introduction =

The steps to releasing Se-IDE (because I keep forgetting something)


= Details =

  # Get it 'good enough' on trunk
  # Create a branch (/branches/ide-x.y.z) to run rc's on
  # Change -SNAPSHOT to -RC-N
  # Add branch to bamboo
  # Distribute URL to build artifact
  # Get it 'good enough' on the branch
  # Remove the -RC-N stuff
  # Wait for build
  # Download build from bamboo
  # Do a quick test
  # Upload final xpi to /tmp on releases.seleniumhq.org
  # Become the release user (sudo su - release) and copy release.openqa.org/htdocs/selenium-ide/1.0.6 
  # update website release page
  # test download
  # update update.rdf
  # test upgrade
  # update release notes
  # close out issues in the tracker
  # announce
  # merge your changes from the branch to trunk so a reversion exists with just the clean version
  # increment the version with -SNAPSHOT
  # disable branch build in bamboo
