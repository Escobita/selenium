The steps to releasing Se-IDE (because I keep forgetting something)


= Details =

  # Download release candidate build from bamboo
  # Upload XPIs to release.seleniumhq.org
    # SFTP to www.openqa.org and upload all XPIs from the Bamboo build used for the release
    # SSH to www.openqa.org
    # Copy all XPIs to /tmp
    # Switch to the release user (sudo su - release)
    # Copy the XPIs to the relevant locations in release.openqa.org/htdocs/selenium-ide
    # Make sure the multi-xpi is in selenium-ide/x.x.x and the editor is in selenium-ide/editor/x.x.x
  # Update download page on seleniumhq.org with new release details
  # Test download
  # Add the release to the update.rdf files the IDE iteself and all bundled plugins
    # Add a new `<RDF:li>` at the top for the new release
    # Make sure the following are correct
      * `<em:version>` matches the new version number
      * `<em:maxVersion>` matches the Firefox version support
      * `<em:updateLink>` matches the download link for XPI
      * `<em:updateHash>` is the correct hash for the XPI
        * You can generate this using: openssl md5 -sha1 `<file>`
        * Note that for the IDE the hash is of the multi-xpi
        * Make sure the value starts with sha1:
  # Test upgrade
  # Update release notes
  # Announce
