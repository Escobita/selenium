A final release will be done once the beta has been out and successfully used on a number of projects. Other drivers have been left off because none have been started.

== The Future ==

The following are also planned:

  * *JsonWireProtocol* --- The formalisation of the current FirefoxDriver wire protocol in [http://www.json.org/ JSON].
  * *SocketServer* --- Providing a socket server that understands the JsonWireProtocol for the existing InternetExplorerDriver and SafariDriver.
  * *RemoteWebDriver* --- The ability to control a single instance of WebDriver on one machine from another.
  * *FarmedWebDriver* --- Built on top of RemoteWebDriver, this will allow the use of WebDriver on a grid.
