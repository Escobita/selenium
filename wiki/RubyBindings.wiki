#summary Ruby bindings

= Introduction =

The Ruby bindings are currently available as the [http://gemcutter.org/gems/selenium-webdriver selenium-webdriver] gem (on Gemcutter). The gem will be renamed to "selenium" and follow the major version numbers from the main project when Selenium 2.0 is released.

= Details =

The bindings provide a slightly rubified version of the WebDriver API:

{{{
require "selenium-webdriver"

driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
driver.navigate.to "http://google.com"

element = driver.find_element(:name, 'q')
element.send_keys "Hello WebDriver!"
element.submit

puts driver.title

driver.quit
}}}
