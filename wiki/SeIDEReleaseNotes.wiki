=Selenium IDE - Release Notes=

==1.0.5==

One thing that does not really fit the BUG or NEW label is that the code for Se-IDE is now in the main repo rather than tucked away in a somewhat hidden location.

  * BUG - user formats were not appearing in the list (Adam Goucher)
  * BUG - constrained how iframes were loaded; which is why AMO was unhappy (Adam Goucher)
  * BUG - a whole bunch of tweaks to the existing formats (Dave Hunt)
  * BUG - a bunch of French translation fixes / additions (Jérémy Hérault)
  * BUG - the reload user extensions button only shows up if you have the developer tool checkbox checked (Jérémy Hérault)
  * BUG - labelling access keys on test runner (Olle Jonsson)
  * BUG - cleaned up a bunch of references from OpenQA to SeleniumHQ (Olle Jonsson)
  * BUG - had an = instead of == (Olle Jonsson)
  * BUG - adding a bunch of ;'s to make jslint shut up (Olle Jonsson)
  * BUG - getting rid of the 'setting something that only has a getter' message in Firefox 3.6 (Dan Fabulich)
  * NEW - self hosting of updates to avoid delays at AMO (Adam Goucher)
  * NEW - the version of se-ide is now in the title bar (Adam Goucher)
  * NEW - added some Se-IDE specific icons here and there (Adam Goucher, Dave Hunt)
  * NEW - preferences can now be Bool's as well (Adam Goucher)
  * NEW - added addPlugin(id) to the plugin API (Adam Goucher)
  * NEW - added a new panel to the Options screen around plugins. It doesn't do much now other than list the plugins that registered themselves through addPlugin, but should do more for 1.0.6 (Adam Goucher)

==1.0.4==

Selenium IDE 1.0.4 marks a resurgence in the project with releases planned for the middle of each month. Here are the changes that have happened between versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.4 of Selenium IDE. (Don't ask what happened to version 1.0.3)

  * BUG - Supported Firefox version increased to include the 3.6 series (Santiago Suarez Ordoñez)
  * BUG - Removed the Ruby formatter that was flagged as 'deprecated' (Adam Goucher)
  * NEW - Ruby formatter updated to use the selenium-client gem ( http://selenium-client.rubyforge.org/ ) (Adam Goucher)
  * NEW - Ability to add custom user-extensions to extend the Selenium API through plugins to Selenium IDE (Adam Goucher)
  * NEW - Ability to add custom formatters to extend which languages are available to users through plugins to Selenium IDE (Adam Goucher)
  * NEW - Can now load changes to user extensions without having to restart Selenium IDE (Jérémy Hérault)
  * NEW - RSpec formatter

===Acknowledgements===

Version 1.0.4 would not have happened without the following assistance
  * Sauce Labs' sponsoring of Adam Goucher to work on it
  * Jérémy Hérault and the SERLI team for their Helium plugin (which was the proof an API could / should be developed for Se-IDE)
  * Dave Hunt for his feedback on pre-release versions

For issues with this release or features you would like to see in future releases, please log them in the Google Code Issue tracker (http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list) using the _ide_ label so they don't get lost.
