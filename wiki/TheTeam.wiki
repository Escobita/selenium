= Meet the Team =

If you've ever wondered who to thank (or blame!) for Selenium, then you've come to the right place. This page introduces you to the contributors and shows you what they're working on.

*SimonStewart*: Original WebDriver developer and leading the Selenium 2 effort. He works mainly with Java and can be seen all over the code base, patching holes and adding features. By day he works as a Software Engineer in Test at Google. By night, he hacks on the crazy fun build grammar.
