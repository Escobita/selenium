If you've ever wondered who to thank (or blame!) for Selenium, then you've come to the right place. This page introduces you to the contributors and shows you what they're working on.

*SimonStewart*: Original WebDriver developer and leading the Selenium 2 effort. He works mainly with Java and can be seen all over the code base, patching holes and adding features. By day he works as a Software Engineer in Test at Google. By night, he hacks on the crazy fun build grammar.

*Julian Harty*: Dabbled with `WebDriver` since 2007 mainly finding ways to make the code real and useful by testing it, and by documenting it. Currently working at eBay to find ways to make software testing more efficient and effective. He's also involved in various [http://code.google.com/u/julianharty open source initiatives], accessibility software, and writing material.
