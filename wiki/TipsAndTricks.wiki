= Tips and Tricks =

== Using Drag and Drop ==

It may not be immediately obvious, but if you're using a browser that supports it you can cast a {{{WebElement}}} to {{{RenderedWebElement}}} and then it's easy to do drag and drop:

{{{
// Note the casts
RenderedWebElement from = (RenderedWebElement) driver.findElement(By.id("one"));
RenderedWebElement to = (RenderedWebElement) driver.findElement(By.id("two"));

from.dragAndDropOn(to);
}}}

Currently, only the FirefoxDriver supports this, but you should also expect support for the InternetExplorerDriver too.

== Changing the user agent ==

This is easy with the FirefoxDriver:

{{{
FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile();
profile.addAdditionalPreference("general.useragent.override", "some UA string");
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile);
}}}

== Tweaking an existing Firefox profile ==

Suppose that you wanted to modify the user agent string (as above), but you've got a tricked out Firefox profile that contains dozens of useful extensions. There are two ways to obtain this profile. Assuming that the profile has been created using Firefox's profile manager ("firefox -ProfileManager"):

{{{
ProfileIni allProfiles = new ProfilesIni();
FirefoxProfile profile = allProfiles.getProfile("WebDriver");
profile.setPreferences("foo.bar", 23);
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile);
}}}

Alternatively, if the profile isn't already registered with Firefox:

{{{
File profileDir = new File("path/to/top/level/of/profile");
FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile(profileDir);
profile.addAdditionalPreferences(extraPrefs);
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile);
}}}

== Enabling features that might not be wise to use in Firefox ==

As we develop features in the FirefoxDriver, we expose the ability to use them. For example, until we feel native events are stable on Firefox for Linux, they are disabled by default. To enable them:

{{{
FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile();
profile.setEnableNativeEvents(true);
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile);
}}}
