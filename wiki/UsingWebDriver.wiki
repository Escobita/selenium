#summary Using WebDriver in your project and finding the jars and required libraries

= Using !WebDriver =

== From a New Download ==

There are two [http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list downloads] that you will generally want to chose:

   * {{{selenium-server-standalone.jar}}} - This contains the Selenium server (required if you want to use the Selenium 1.x classes) and the RemoteWebDriver server as a standalone jar, that can be executed using {{{java -jar}}}. Note that this JAR contains _all_ of the required dependencies. If you'd prefer to manage the classpath yourself, then download the "selenium-server-XXX.zip" file.

   * The language bindings for your language of choice. If you're using Java, then download the latest {{{selenium-java-XXX.zip}}} where "XXX" represents the version number. For .Net, the appropriate zip is the {{{selenium-dotnet-XXX.zip}}}.

== With Maven ==

To use the client libraries (the remote webdriver client, ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, HtmlUnitDriver, InternetExplorerDriver, OperaDriver, and support libraries) Add the following dependencies to your project:

{{{
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    <version>2.13.0</version>
  </dependency>
}}}

If you want to start a selenium server, you will need the following dependency:

{{{
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
    <artifactId>selenium-server</artifactId>
    <version>2.13.0</version>
  </dependency>
}}}

That's it. 

== From a Fresh CheckOut ==

 * Follow the instructions in CheckOut in order to get the latest version of !WebDriver.
 * Run {{{rake}}} without any targets (that is, just run {{{rake}}}) This will run the unit tests too, and if that's not what you want to do, just run: {{{rake all}}}
 * Figure out which drivers you will need on your project. You'll need at least *common*, but depending on your needs you may or may not want the drivers for *Firefox* (FirefoxDriver), *Internet Explorer* (InternetExplorerDriver), and/or *HtmlUnit* (HtmlUnitDriver) The JARs for the classes in "org.openqa.selenium" are located in subdirectories of the "build" directory. It should be obvious what is where. The OperaDriver is located in _/third_party/java/opera-driver/_.
 * Now, just copy the required runtime libraries and the newly built jars on to your CLASSPATH. Read the {{{build.desc}}} files to figure out what these are.
