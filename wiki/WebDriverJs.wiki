== Introduction ==

The !JavaScript bindings for !WebDriver (WebDriverJS) are currently under development. They are available for use by adventurous souls willing to experiment with the latest and greatest.

*Warning*: WebDriverJS is targeted at developers comfortable with asynchronous programming. Users new to !JavaScript may find WebDriverJS difficult to work with.

== The Code ==

WebDriverJS source was built using the [http://code.google.com/p/closure-library/ Google Closure] library.  The source can be found in the `//javascript/webdriver-jsapi` package, with all unit tests and end-to-end tests in the `test` and `test/e2e` sub-packages, respectively.

=== Building ===

A single script, which may be deployed in either Node or the browser, may be generated by running:

{{{
$ ./go webdriverjs
}}}

=== Running the Tests ===

{{{
# Run the unit tests for Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Opera:
$ ./go \
    //javascript/webdriver-jsapi:test_chrome:run \
    //javascript/webdriver-jsapi:test_firefox:run \
    //javascript/webdriver-jsapi:test_ie:run \
    //javascript/webdriver-jsapi:test_opera:run

# Run the end-to-end tests:
$ ./go \
    //javascript/webdriver-jsapi:test_chrome_e2e:run \
    //javascript/webdriver-jsapi:test_firefox_e2e:run \
    //javascript/webdriver-jsapi:test_ie_e2e:run \
    //javascript/webdriver-jsapi:test_opera_e2e:run
}}}

=== Debugging Unit Tests ===

All of the unit tests may be debugged using the standard debug server. Upon starting the server, open any browser to `http://localhost:2310/javascript/webdriver-jsapi/test` and select the test to run.

{{{
./go debug-server
}}}

=== Debugging E2E Tests ===

A full debug story for WebDriverJS is still in the works.  In the meantime, a simple Node app has been provided for experimenting with the API.

{{{
$ ./go webdriverjs build/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server/server-standalone.jar
$ java -jar build/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server/server-standalone.jar
$ node javascript/webdriver-jsapi/node/demo.js --help
}}}

This same app may be used to manually run the browser-based e2e tests for debugging:

{{{
$ ./go debug-server
$ java -jar build/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server/server-standalone.jar
$ node javascript/webdriver-jsapi/node/demo.js \
  --browser=chrome \
  --wdUrl=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub \
  --url=http://localhost:2310/javascript/webdriver-jsapi/test/e2e/example_test.html
}}}
